## 📄 Contribution Guidelines

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Clone it. Remix it. Restructure timelines. Just respect the core formatting flow.

2. **Read the README**  
   Start [here](./README.md) to understand the story architecture and repo structure.

3. **Use Pull Requests for All Submissions**  
   Clearly explain:
   - What you’re adding (chapter, challenge, art, etc.)
   - Which node or layer it belongs to (e.g. `Chapter_07/7A/Layer_2_Challenge`)
   - Any lore context, challenge purpose, or bugs fixed

4. **Follow Code Style + File Naming Standards**
   - Solidity: Use consistent formatting + comment headers
   - Markdown: Use `main.md`, `challenge.sol`, `walkthrough.md` per node
   - File names: Use underscores (`_`) not spaces. Match structure of existing folders.

## 🧬 Getting Started

- Want to write your first story fork?  
  Clone a chapter and remix it into a new timeline (`7B_Memory-Flood`, for example)

- Want to add a smart contract?  
  Check [`challenge.sol`](./Chapter_07/7A_Earth-Ambition/Layer_1_Challenge/challenge.sol) for a model and add your variant in a new folder (`Layer_2_Challenge`)

- Want to contribute art or design?  
  Add to `NFT_Prompt.md` or submit a visual concept in `/assets/`
