# Book One Hybrid Structure & Editing Plan

## Overview

Goal:  
Condense the rough 32-chapter draft of Book One into a streamlined, newbie-friendly hybrid version that reduces redundancy and seamlessly sets up Book Two. Each chapter will integrate:
- The best narrative elements from the original drafts.
- An NFT prompt (story visual + coding prompt visual).
- A Solidity quiz and challenge.

Purpose:  
This document will serve as a roadmap so that when communicating with Manus, everyone is aligned on what needs to be built into the website.

## Proposed Folder Structure


## Process Workflow

1. **Review & Compare Versions:**  
   Compare the original 32-chapter draft with the refined version. Decide what narrative elements to keep, merge, or remove.

2. **Draft New Hybrid Chapters:**  
   For each chapter, create a new version that blends the best parts of both drafts, ensuring a smooth, accessible narrative.

3. **Integrate NFT Prompts:**  
   - Define an NFT prompt for each chapter (e.g., a story visual and a coding prompt visual).
   - Generate or specify image prompts and add corresponding markdown files with details.

4. **Add Solidity Challenges:**  
   At the end of each chapter file, include:
   - A quiz (Markdown file) to reinforce learning.
   - A Solidity challenge (Solidity file) that ties into the chapter’s theme.

5. **Iterative Feedback:**  
   Use GitHub issues or pull requests to track changes as chapters are edited. Update the files and folders as you refine each chapter.

## Next Steps

- **Mapping the Chapters:**  
  Create an outline (or table) listing which chapters to merge, keep, or delete from the 32-chapter draft.

- **Initial Edits:**  
  Begin by editing the first chapter following the process above. Place the updated file in `/Book_One_Hybrid/Chapters/`.

- **Collaboration:**  
  Once initial drafts and folder structure are in place, share the repository with Manus along with this guide.

This document provides a clear roadmap and structure that both you and Manus can reference. Save this file in your repository, and then we can move on to setting up the folders and starting the chapter-by-chapter editing process.

### Step 2: Create Folders (Optional via GitHub UI)

If you want to create the folder structure directly on GitHub:
1. In your repository, click "Add file" → "Create new file."
2. In the filename field, type the folder name and a dummy file, e.g., `Book_One_Hybrid/Chapters/.gitkeep` (the `.gitkeep` file is a placeholder so that the folder is tracked).
3. Repeat this for the other folders: `NFT_Prompts`, `Solidity_Challenges`, `Sales_Page`, and `Documentation`.

### Step 3: Communicate with Manus

Once your folder structure and initial planning document are in place, you can share the repository link with Manus. This will provide a clear map of what needs to be built into the website and how the editing process will be managed.
