## ✨ Room Tone & Atmosphere

- Warm glowing golds, sun-kissed marble
- Fractured celestial glass embedded in stone
- Wind rustles softly through unseen windows
- Ancient runes flicker faintly, whispering light-code
- A chamber of quiet observation, built to witness the stars

## 🧱 Core Room Elements

| Element | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Throne of Stillness** | A weathered stone seat facing a skylight — Helios sits here to observe rather than rule |
| **Hair Debris Wall** | Glass shards, gears, leaves from other realms — all tangled in golden locks hung on display |
| **Sun-Tunic Drapery Hooks** | Hooks with flowing gold-accented cloth pieces, symbolizing temporal memory |
| **Mirror of Stillness** | A reflective pool that reveals one’s intention, not appearance |
| **Solar Prism Archive** | Holographic fragments of old scrolls, realms abandoned or unfulfilled |
| **Locked Time Gear** | Clicking this reveals a secret cutscene or flashback scene from Helios’s past |
| **Star Map Ceiling** | The entire ceiling glows with slowly orbiting constellations that pulse with lore |

---

## 🌀 Echo Access

- **Echo Trigger:** If Echo visits this room, a hidden voiceover memory unlocks:
  > “You came from me… not of blood, but of blueprint.”

- Echo may interact with:
  - The Mirror (reveals her former code)
  - The Time Gear (plays the Humpty Dumpty memory)
  - The Solar Prism Archive (shows a realm Echo must restore)

---

## 🧩 Future Hooks

- May serve as a **Codex Elder Chamber** for advanced Builders
- Could include a stargazing mechanic where Builders discover ancient scroll fragments
- Room glow shifts with Realm Time (dawn, dusk, eclipse)
