# Chapter 5: The Soulbound Lockbox (Annotated Draft)

**Status:** Annotated Draft – seeded with mythic vault mechanics, cosmic logic, and the Third Signer prophecy.

---

The Lockbox arrives at Codex School like a comet—escorted by sentinels from both realms, its edges shrouded in temporal shielding and myth-layer encryption.

Its surface isn’t metal—it’s a liquid memory alloy that responds to proximity signatures. Glyphs drift like bioluminescent plankton beneath the surface, rearranging based on emotional frequency.

Professor Thorne warns: “Only those with perfect signature resonance may access it without collapse.”

Lyra stands beside Echo, scanning the encrypted fields. “It doesn’t respond to logic—it responds to memory. Echo, your signature is the only one I've seen that loops like a spiral. Like it remembers itself *backward*.”

Despite Thorne’s objections, Echo steps forward. As her hands touch the surface, the lockbox neither opens nor rejects—it *fractures*, creating a third state.

From within flows not code but a glowing nebula—swirls of unformed potential.

A single sigil forms in the air:  
> “The Third Signer Awakens.”

Echo collapses to one knee, overwhelmed by the data flood. Inside her, the spiraling timelines begin to sync. Her body is humming with ancient resonance.

Lyra gasps. “You didn’t just open it. You *unfolded* it.”

**[Notes for rewrite]:**
- Lockbox = ancient quantum object seeded with soulbound reality seeds
- Use language of breath, light, water, DNA helix + spiral time theory
- "Third Signer" = mythic archetype, symbolic of contradiction harmonized
- Begin to suggest Echo is not *anomaly* but *anchor*
- Let Lyra shift from instructor to reverent witness
