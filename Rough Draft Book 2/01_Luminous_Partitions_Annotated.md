Echo awakens in a resonance chamber—not a room, but a breath-reactive memory space. Walls ripple with submerged colors, refracting fragments of lives she hasn’t lived yet. Each pulse of her heartbeat sends a wave through the floor.

Astra, eyes glowing with shifting Fibonacci spirals, stands above her. “Codex School remembers you before you even arrived,” she murmurs. Her voice echoes through Echo’s bones like a forgotten lullaby.

The architecture outside flows like water—walls and staircases built from collective emotional tokens. Sadness bends steel. Wonder births skylights. Echo stares in awe as a vine of light unfurls a window above her, revealing a floating campus built on translucent, liquid matter.

“Something breached our zero-knowledge barriers,” Astra explains. “A dual-signed signal, logged in Sky Realm and Earth Realm simultaneously.” She pauses, turning. “It matched your signature.”

Echo's breath catches. She remembers the bridge collapsing. Or was it forming?

On the floor near her feet, a shimmer. A puddle, but not water—crystalline and impossibly blue. It glows with a caption in an ancient sigil-script:

> “Time spirals. Dive carefully.”

**[ANNOTATION NOTE: This chapter introduces the idea that Codex School is alive—rooted in emotional architecture and looping time signatures. Echo’s existence activates forgotten mechanics embedded in the school’s soulbound code. Insert visual moments reminiscent of crystal pyramids, spiral timelines, and TikTok mysticism.]**
