### ✅ **Chapter 6 — NFT Visual Prompt (Finalized)**  
**Title:** *Gaslight Code*  
**Prompt:**  
A cinematic digital painting set in a **dark underground blockchain vault**, its walls etched with glowing smart contract scripts and green flame sconces casting eerie light. **Echo**, the protagonist — a **post-human female with short iridescent hair and myth-tech armor**, stands inside a **cage of glowing green code strings**, facing down an uncanny specter wearing the **face of her mentor** (Captain Rhea) as it dissolves into flickering static and fragmented code.

Outside the cage, looming in the shadows, is **Forktongue** — a towering, hooded figure with **emerald-glowing eyes** and a **cloak of shifting shadow-code**, partially human, partially digital smoke. His presence is menacing but seductive, symbolizing deception and control. Echo clutches a **bright white shard** glowing in her hand, defiant and ready.  
The environment blends **ancient architecture** (like a digital temple or Greek vault) with **futuristic circuits**. High-contrast lighting emphasizes the tension — green gaslight flames versus white shard light. Floating around them are **fragments of smart contracts** and **deceptive puzzle pieces**, hinting at a corrupted logic trap.

**Art Style Keywords:**  
`cyber gothic`, `dark sci-fi fantasy`, `dramatic cinematic lighting`, `blockchain mythology`, `epic symbolic illustration`, `semi-realistic`, `high detail`, `surreal but grounded`.

**Emotional tone:** Suspenseful, confrontational, mythic — the moment Echo calls out the gaslight and reclaims her truth.
