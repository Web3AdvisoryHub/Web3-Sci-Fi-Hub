### üé® **Chapter 6 ‚Äî Sora NFT Prompt (Visual Scene)**

**Prompt:**  
*A cinematic digital painting of a mythic underground blockchain vault, blending ancient temple architecture with futuristic circuit motifs. At the center, a fierce post-human woman named Echo ‚Äî with short iridescent hair, glowing myth-tech armor, and a bright white data-shard in hand ‚Äî stands inside a cage of glowing green code strings. Outside the cage, a hooded villain named Forktongue looms ‚Äî a tall, shadowy humanoid with emerald-glowing eyes and a cloak made of shifting dark code and smoke. Near them, a false mentor figure (Captain Rhea) dissolves into static, exposing the gaslight illusion. Green torch flames cast eerie light on stone walls covered in glowing smart contract scripts. Floating fragments of broken code and glowing puzzle pieces swirl around them. The lighting is dramatic and high-contrast, with Echo's shard casting bright white light against Forktongue‚Äôs toxic green glare.*

### üß† **Chapter 6 ‚Äî Sora NFT Prompt (Solidity Challenge Visual)**

**Prompt:**  
*A symbolic illustration of a smart contract trap inside a blockchain-themed vault. Five glowing handprints float in the air like ghostly signatures, hovering above a circular consensus sigil on the floor. The sigil is partially fractured, with one piece flickering uncertainly. Floating holographic contract panels hover above, each showing clauses like ‚Äú5 Signatures Required,‚Äù ‚ÄúOverride Active,‚Äù and ‚ÄúConsensus Failed.‚Äù In the background, Forktongue, a cloaked shadow figure with glowing green eyes and a serpentine forked tongue, hovers smugly near a glowing override rune. Chains of green code twist through the air like vines. Echo, a mythic cyber-warrior with a shard in hand, crouches beside the sigil, analyzing the contract logic. The mood is tense and cerebral, like a battle of minds.*
