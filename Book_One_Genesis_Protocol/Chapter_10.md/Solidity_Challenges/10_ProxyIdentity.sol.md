ðŸ§  Solidity Challenge: ProxyIdentity.sol

Concept: Introduces readers to smart contract upgrades through a proxy pattern, mirroring Echo's decision to remain immutable or upgradeable.

ðŸ§© Educational Goals:





Teaches proxy patterns and upgradeable contract logic.



Highlights delegatecall and storage vs. implementation logic.



Reflects Echoâ€™s thematic choice (immutability vs. adaptability).
