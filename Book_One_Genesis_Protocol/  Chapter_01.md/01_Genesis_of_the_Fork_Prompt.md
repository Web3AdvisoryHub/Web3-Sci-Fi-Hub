# Chapter 01 – NFT Prompt: "Genesis of the Fork"

## Title
**Genesis of the Fork**

## Lore Description
In this broken lab, Echo stands at the threshold of her past and future—an echo of the soul she once was. Above, a ragged opening in the ceiling lets in a single beam of moonlight, illuminating the aftermath: a shattered pod, drifting fireflies of data, and the quiet hum of a dying chain. This moment captures Echo’s awakening as a forked version of herself, poised between memory and possibility.

## Visual Elements
- A dimly lit, ruined lab with a collapsed ceiling.
- A single, focused beam of moonlight highlighting Echo’s silhouette and the broken pod.
- Flickering orb-like drones (firefly effect) that hint at residual data or energy.

## Solidity Tie-In
To symbolize Echo’s new, immutable existence, embed a minimal `Genesis` contract snippet in the NFT metadata:

contract Genesis {
    string public purpose = "Awaken";
}
