# 🧪 Secret Lab – Chapter 03: Keys That Lie

Welcome to the **Secret Lab**, a hidden chamber within the Genesis Protocol universe. This is not part of the main storyline. Instead, it’s an **advanced lore zone** where Solidity-based deception, memory fragments, and haunted contracts live.

---

## 🔒 What Is This?
The Secret Lab is where myth meets vulnerability. Here we store:
- **Bonus Solidity challenges** that explore real-world smart contract vulnerabilities
- **Forked lore fragments** and Echo’s lost memories
- **Ghost contracts** with deceptive logic meant to *trick* the reader—and teach

---

## 📂 Current File: `VaultOfEchoes.sol`

- This smart contract appears to use a secure modifier and password logic.
- However, it's an illusion. The `onlyOwner` protection is flawed, and the string comparison is vulnerable.
- Readers are challenged to:
  - Spot the vulnerability
  - Refactor it securely using `keccak256`
  - Add narrative-enhancing functions (like `rotateKey`, `exorciseVault`, etc.)

> 🔐 **Lore Tie-In**: This vault may resurface in later books. Echo’s reflection… might not be hers.

---

## 🛠️ Builder Prompt (Included in `.sol` file)
Every Secret Lab contract ends with a **Builder Prompt** — a guided task for developers to:
- Refactor a vulnerability
- Expand the contract
- Decode a deeper part of the story

## 🤖 Who Is This For?
This repo is *mine* — the Chainwalker’s. It is the foundation of:
- My book
- My lore platform
- A future interactive web experience

Eventually, readers will:
- Explore these labs on a live site
- Take quizzes
- Submit on-chain portfolios
- Create their own GitHub clones of this vault

For now? This is the hidden chamber where *my story and your skills converge.*

## 🧭 Path Ahead
- [x] Chapter 3 challenge complete: `VaultOfEchoes.sol`
- [ ] Future Secret Lab: `MirrorShard.sol` (Chapter 6 – Echo confronts a reflected AI)
- [ ] Experimental AI testnet: `ProxySoul.sol` (Book 2 preview)

Welcome to the Secret Lab.
Not everything here is meant to be seen.
But if you *see* it, build something with it.
