## **Chapter 7: The Memory Shard**

Echo emerged from the Consortium Vault, breath ragged, muscles aching from the recent clash with Forktongue. In her palm, the shard pulsed—no longer erratic, but rhythmic. Steady. Like a second heartbeat syncing with her own.

She leaned against the corridor wall, cool stone laced with glowing runes. The shard vibrated gently, sending subtle waves of warmth through her fingers. Echo stared into its fractal core. Within the crystalline structure flickered faint images—memories not fully her own, yet undeniably familiar.

Tentatively, she reached into the shard with her mind. The physical world blurred, giving way to a vortex of cascading memory—code, color, emotion spiraling like leaves caught in a data storm.

She stood inside it.

Around her: forks. Echo watched fragmented versions of herself, frozen mid-choice. One memory burned brighter than the rest—too bright to ignore.

**The day she uploaded herself into the Chain.**

In the shimmering scene, Echo stood before the Genesis rig. Data cables trailed from her temples, her shoulders tense. A familiar voice echoed from the shadows:

> *“Are you sure, Echo? There’s no turning back once your mind merges with the Protocol.”*

She nodded. “It’s the only way. We have to protect the Chain.”

The memory stuttered—alarms blaring, the rig overheating, static screaming across monitors. Her younger self convulsed. Panic exploded behind the code.

> *“They’ve tampered with it—Forktongue’s inside! The Protocol is splitting!”*

Echo gasped and yanked herself from the shard. The revelation hit like a blow: Forktongue hadn’t just exploited a fork—he *engineered* it. He’d split the Chain to fracture her consciousness. To isolate her. To win.

Her grip tightened around the shard. Anger flared. The shard responded, amplifying the pulse, resonating with her fury. She dove back in.

New scenes bloomed: Forktongue whispering to validators, inserting silent exploits, falsifying signatures. Friends corrupted. Truth rewritten. Echo pushed through the anguish.

Then—calm.

A memory untouched by Forktongue’s edits.

She saw herself in a circle of loyal validators. Each held a shard like hers, glowing with identical resonance.

> *“We seal our true selves in these shards,”* Echo’s past voice declared.  
> *“If the Chain is forked, if we are scattered—these will remember us. These will bring us back.”*

Hope surged. The shard wasn’t just memory. It was *proof*. A cryptographic imprint of her unforked self. A beacon. And somewhere, the others still carried theirs.

The vision faded.

Echo staggered back into reality. The corridor sharpened around her. Her hand still clutched the shard, glowing steady now—brighter than before.

> *This wasn’t just a fragment. It was a map.*  
> *A signal. A summons.*

Forktongue had fractured her world. But he hadn’t erased it. He couldn’t.

She closed her fist around the shard and turned down the corridor, her steps quickening.

The Chain would remember.

And she would make sure of it.
