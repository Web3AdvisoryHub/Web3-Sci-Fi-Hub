**Title:** `The Memory Shard – Soul Resonance`

---

### 📖 **Lore Description**

> When Echo first grasps the shard, it feels inert. But the moment her heartbeat syncs with its pulse, it begins to hum — not just with energy, but with *identity*. This relic contains fragmented versions of herself: preserved truth sealed in quantum glass, immune to Forktongue’s revisions.  
>  
> Each flicker within the shard is a forked memory… but only one leads back to her original self. As Echo reconnects with the core imprint, the shard glows brighter — becoming a soul-key that resonates with other loyalists still lost in the chain.  
>  
> This NFT represents not just memory — but **proof of unity across the fractured ledger**.

### 🧠 **Function in the World**
- Used to reassemble truth in a world of rewritten consensus.
- Anchors Echo’s unforked identity in a tampered system.
- Connects her to others who carry the same embedded signature.

---

### 🖼️ **Visual Elements**
- A **floating memory shard**—glassy, prism-like, hovering in a zero-gravity corridor.
- Inside the shard: flickers of light, each one a miniature version of Echo in different poses (representing forked timelines).
- Ambient chains of glowing glyphs spiral slowly around it.
- Behind: the outline of a Genesis rig in shadows, and faint silhouettes of other shards pulsing in the dark distance.
