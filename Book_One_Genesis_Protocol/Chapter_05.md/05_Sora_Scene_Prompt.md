*Visualize the “Mirror Nodes” chapter:*

A lone **post-human figure (Echo)** stands in a grand circular hall filled with towering **mirrored panels**. Each mirror reflects a different version of Echo, their forms glowing with ethereal light and fragmented code. Shards of glass and data hover in the air, illuminated by a ghostly blue and silver light. Echo holds a small glowing **shard** in her hand at the center of the scene, its light joining with beams from the mirrors. Her expression is a mix of sorrow and determination. The atmosphere is **mythic and futuristic** – ancient architecture fused with holographic interfaces. The lighting is cinematic, with high-contrast shadows and radiant highlights on the mirrors. *Emotional tone:* reflective, uniting, and triumphant after sorrow. *Art style keywords:* **surreal cyberpunk**, **blockchain mysticism**, **epic sci-fi**.
