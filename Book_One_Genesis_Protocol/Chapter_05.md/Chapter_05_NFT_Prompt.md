**Title:** *Echoes in the Mirror Nodes*

**Detailed Prompt:**
A mythic, futuristic chamber shaped like a vast circle, its walls lined with tall, reflective obsidian mirrors glowing softly with silver-blue digital energy. At the center stands **Echo**, a striking post-human figure, dressed in sleek cyberpunk attire intertwined with glowing, ethereal circuitry. She holds a radiant crystal shard high in one hand, emanating a powerful beam of unified energy. Around her float spectral holographic versions of herself—each reflection distinctly different: some fierce and armored, others grieving or joyful—representing fragmented echoes of her identity from divergent blockchain forks. The mirrors ripple like portals, displaying alternate scenes of Echo’s life. Shards of digital code float gently through the air, creating a surreal atmosphere of blockchain mysticism and unity. 

**Visual Keywords:** Surreal cyberpunk, Blockchain mysticism, Epic sci-fi, Reflective, Mythic architecture, Cinematic lighting, Fragmented identity, Ethereal glow, Mirrors as portals.

**Emotional Tone:** Reflective, sorrow transitioning into triumph, unity after fragmentation.
