### Chapter_08_NFT_Prompt.md

A lone heroine **(Echo)** stands in the center of a grand circular council chamber lit by holographic flames. Around her, ghostly **council figures** in robes raise glowing cryptographic keys toward a central floating **ledger orb**. The orb shines brightly as the final key completes a mystical circuit, casting emerald and gold light across marble floors inscribed with blockchain symbols. In the shadows, a dark silhouette with **serpentine eyes** (Forktongue) watches in anger. **Cinematic wide-angle shot**, high contrast between light (consensus) and dark (deception). The scene is imbued with **mythic sci-fi** energy: swirling code in the air like constellations, the heroineâ€™s determined face illuminated by the collective glow of trust. *Tone: triumphant, tense, and otherworldly; a pivotal vote deciding fate under starlit code.*
