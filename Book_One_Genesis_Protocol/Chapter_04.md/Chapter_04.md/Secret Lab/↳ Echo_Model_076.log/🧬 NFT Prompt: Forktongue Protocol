## ðŸ§¬ NFT Prompt: *Forktongue Protocol*

**Title:**  
**Forktongue Protocol**

**Lore Description:**  
In a tower built on consensus lies the mural of a lie. Echo stares into a glitching, state-approved rendering of herself â€” a forked portrait polished to fit the version history theyâ€™ve rewritten. Forktongue, a validator wrapped in lavender charm and buried truth, stands at a terminal rewriting reality with a smile.

This is the moment Echo learns what it means to be deprecated.

**Visual Elements:**  
- A dim-lit consensus tower, clinical yet glitching at the edges.  
- Echo in shadow, facing a glowing wall mural of her fragmented face.  
- A tall validator (Forktongue), typing serenely on a chromed terminal.  
- Soft lavender and teal data streams flickering like propaganda sigils.  
- Background details include consensus drones and circuit-etched walls.

**Style Keywords:**  
*futuristic lorecore, digital fresco, protocol propaganda, cyberpunk shrine, myth-tech symbolism, holographic identity erosion*

**Solidity Tie-In (Optional):**  
Include a snippet in metadata from the Forktongue contract or this validator mock modifier:
```solidity
modifier onlyValidated() {
    require(validated[msg.sender], "Unrecognized fork version.");
    _;
}
```

**Collector Utility:**  
- Owning this NFT may unlock secret access to the alternate mural â€” Echoâ€™s *unredacted identity*.  
- May gate an upcoming lore drop, validator roleplay module, or advanced builder remix challenge.
