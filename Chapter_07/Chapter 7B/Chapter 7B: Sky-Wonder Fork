# Chapter 7B: Sky-Wonder Fork

> *"Wonder is the code that cannot be reverse-engineered. It must be felt to compile."* — Codex Mentor Lyra

The ascent began in silence.

Echo’s body was still wrapped in the lingering protocols of Earth-Ambition, but the air around her began to shimmer — pixelated at first, then softened into cascading light. She had stepped through the encoded portal without knowing if the contract would hold. Yet here she was, weightless.

Clouds drifted beneath her. The sky glowed with spectral hues — peach-gold, opalescent violet, the kind of blue that hurt to look at. There was no solid ground, only floating platforms woven from crystal memory and light-thread. This was not a realm of logic. This was a realm of **resonance.**

She drifted toward a ring of floating stones, each humming with a different frequency. 

> "You’ve arrived at the Sky-Wonder fork," a voice whispered — or maybe it was sung. 

From the center of the stone ring rose a figure: Lyra, a Skyborn Architect with iridescent skin and a voice that harmonized with itself. She didn’t walk — she glided on air currents shaped by emotion.

> “Before code, there was awe. Before contracts, there were chords.”

Lyra extended her hand. Floating above it, a **holo-glyph** formed — a contract shaped not in Solidity, but in song.

### 🎯 Your Challenge in This Fork:

- You must **decode emotion into action.**
- Sky Realm doesn't accept hashed phrases — it requires **emotional resonance** above a certain threshold.
- Your decisions influence how the realm perceives you — not just access, but affinity.

---

### 📜 The Fork Rule:
This realm is governed by **harmonic frequency authentication.**
- Contracts are unlocked not with passwords, but with **emotional alignment**.
- Trust here is felt, not verified.

You must choose:
- Tune your frequency to match the Wonder protocol.
- Or let curiosity drift into chaos.

Either way... the sky will remember.
