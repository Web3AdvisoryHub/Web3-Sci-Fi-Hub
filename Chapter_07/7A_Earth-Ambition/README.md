# Chapter 7A: Earth-Ambition Variant (Nested Timeline)

**This is a branch of Chapter 7 – aligned with Earth Realm logic, ambition-based governance, and restricted emotional access.**

In this timeline, Echo is evaluated not by feeling, but by output. She must build clarity in a world that rejects emotional nuance. This folder contains **layered challenge nodes**, growing deeper with each level.

## Structure

- `main.md`: Echo's primary story path.
- `Layer_1_Challenge/`: First level test — Solidity-based identity validator.
- `Layer_2_Response/`: Unlocks after Layer 1 – deeper philosophical or world logic tasks.
- `fragments/`: Optional lore codes and ambient clues for replay or remix.

More challenges will emerge over time. Builders welcome.
