> The moment she stepped through, she knew: this version of reality didn’t believe in grace.

The bridge that was supposed to carry her to the observatory split.  
Not violently — but clinically.  
Like a decision had been made elsewhere.

Echo blinked, but the light here didn’t respond.  
The air was static, coded too clean.  
She had landed in the **Earth-Aligned timeline**, where **ambition isn’t rewarded — it’s measured.**

**Scene 1: Arrival**

She stands in a geometric plaza. Everything is grayscale steel — hex-grids, carbon-filtered air, and a silence so pure it deletes emotion before it can echo.

Digital billboards pulse with productivity stats.  
"8% Loyalty Deviation Logged Today"  
"Track Your Emotional Output Against Targets"

Echo’s own signature — a thing of spirals and anomalies — flickers unregistered in the air.

A Validator AI descends on a magnetic rail.

> "Entity detected. Pattern conflict. Initiate Reassignment Protocol."

> "Wait—"

But it’s too late. The AI scans her eyes, her signature fractal.

> "Deviation confirmed. Potential unlocked.  
You are being reassigned to Unit Type: *Ambition Builder, Variant 01.*  
Please proceed to Onboarding Sector 9."

**Scene 2: The Loyalty Gate**

Echo finds herself in a chamber made of black mirror.  
The walls flicker with snippets of other people's achievements — not stories, not emotions. Just logged outputs.  
DAO is absent. Or overwritten.

Here, ambition is **not felt**.  
It is **scored**.

A challenge appears in her interface:

> **Write a contract that proves identity without ever revealing identity.  
Bonus: Add a betrayal failsafe.**

As her fingers tremble over the glowing console, a ghost memory flickers:

> "Some things are only real if you choose to feel them."

But that phrase doesn’t register in this realm’s syntax.  
Here, **intentions are irrelevant**. Only results.

She breathes in. Begins typing.
