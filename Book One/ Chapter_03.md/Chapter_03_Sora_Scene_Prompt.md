## Title:
**Keys That Lie**

## Scene Description:
A cinematic sequence set in a dark, underground vault layered with ancient tech and glowing code. Echo moves cautiously through the chamber as flickering screens stutter to life around her. The air is thick with data particles and drifting holographic runes, glowing in teal and gold.  

The camera follows over-the-shoulder as she approaches a glowing obelisk-shaped vault wall. Suspended in the air before her is a crystalline quantum key—etched with circuit patterns, pulsing with ominous light. As she reaches for it, the shadows shift. A ghostly figure—her digital duplicate—emerges from the darkness, fragmented, glitching, and mimicking her every move with delay.

The vault pulses in slow light stutters, giving the scene a haunted rhythm. When their fingers nearly touch the same key, the ghost's face glitches into Echo's own expression—agonized, whispering static. The entire chamber shakes slightly, like the Chain itself is reacting.
