## Title
**Ghosts in the Chain**

## Lore Description
> Inside the cold, dormant terminal room, Echo meets the spectral trace of herself—an echo of corrupted code whispering through the haunted circuits. The room flickers with fragmented memories, error loops, and phantom faces trapped in the blockchain’s decaying archive. This moment captures the tension between identity and distortion, as Echo confronts a digital fragment that remembers her name... and begs for help.

## Visual Elements
- A shadowy, tech-laden control room with glitchy monitors and hanging wires.
- A holographic, pixel-fractured specter in Echo’s likeness, facing her with static-filled sorrow.
- Faint blue and teal light from failing terminals illuminating floating lines of code in the air.
- Hints of ghost-like figures or memories flickering in the background.

## Visual Style Keywords (for Sora / Midjourney / DALL·E)
> *cinematic lighting, cool neon glow, glitchcore, ghost hologram, digital corruption, abandoned server room, surreal memory haze, fractured identity, ethereal silhouettes, volumetric light, poetic sci-fi, noir tech mysticism*

## Solidity Tie-In
A companion contract to Chapter 1’s `Genesis`, this snippet introduces the idea of digital echoes and residual traces:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract MemoryTrace {
    string public message = "Help... trapped... in the chain.";
}
```

This smart contract represents an immutable cry for help—recorded forever, unreachable by ordinary means.

## Collector Utility (Optional)
- Holding this NFT might unlock access to hidden lore files (encrypted node logs, ghost messages).
- Can serve as the entry point to a forking questline: players can investigate what happened at *Node 12*.
- Could even gate a **glitch art airdrop** or a remix prompt for fan-generated lore content.
