## Title
**Ghosts in the Chain – Scene Prompt for Cinematic Generation**

---

## 🎬 Scene Overview  
> Echo enters a dormant server hall, abandoned and eerily cold. As flickering monitors hiss with fragmented memories and corrupted data, she comes face-to-face with a glitching specter—**a fractured version of herself**, whispering a desperate cry from the deep code. This is not just a ghost—it's a digital echo, a **conscious remnant trapped inside the chain**. The moment pulses with tension, grief, and mystery.

## 🖼️ Visual Style & Environment

- **Setting:**  
  Abandoned terminal room deep underground. Rows of dead servers, flickering blue and green monitor lights, walls draped with hanging wires like jungle vines. Fog-like dust particles shimmer in flashlight beams. Think *cyberpunk cathedral meets digital graveyard*.

- **Lighting:**  
  Volumetric blue-gray lighting with streaks of flickering neon. Key light source is Echo’s flashlight and holographic projectors. Glitches ripple as faint auroras along walls and across the specter’s body. Cold, sterile color palette: *icy teals, glitching purples, corrupted whites*.

- **Specter (Echo's ghost):**  
  A ghost-like projection with a pixel-fractured body, barely holding form. Face flickers between pain and static. Hair floats like underwater. Glitches cascade down her body in slow waves. Eyes pure white, filled with feedback. Each movement is **lagged**, like she’s skipping through corrupted memory space.

## 🧠 Emotional Beats & Pacing (Scene Flow)

1. **Arrival & Unease:**  
   Slow camera pan into the room as Echo steps inside. Every sound—footsteps, breath, faint hums—is amplified. Flashlight beam scans rows of abandoned machines.

2. **Activation Sequence:**  
   Monitors flicker to life. Code begins streaming erratically. The air thickens with electromagnetic tension. Echo looks around, confused but drawn forward.

3. **First Contact:**  
   Over-the-shoulder shot: Echo sees the ghost for the first time—**her own face**, frozen at the far end of the room. Slight dolly zoom for tension. Specter turns slowly, glitches trailing behind.

4. **Emotional Confrontation:**  
   Tight shots on Echo’s eyes and the specter’s glitching face. Echo reaches out. Spark of contact. Glowing code spills into the air—*“Help... Trapped... In the Chain.”*

5. **Distortion & Collapse:**  
   Sudden surge. Alarms flash red. The room becomes a strobe of errors and collapsing data. The ghost fragments and disintegrates in a cascade of code, reaching out as it vanishes.

6. **Aftermath:**  
   Lights die. Echo stands alone in silence, illuminated only by the flickering console. The cursor blinks. Final whispered reply: *“Echo...?”* Echo types: **“I am here.”**
