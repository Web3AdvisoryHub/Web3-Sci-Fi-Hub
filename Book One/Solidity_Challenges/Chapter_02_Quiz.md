# Chapter 02 – Reflection Quiz: Ghosts in the Chain 👻

This quiz explores the themes of identity, memory, and spectral logic from Chapter 02. Reflect on how smart contracts can become echoes—repositories of trapped intent and residual presence.

---

### 🧠 1. What does the `Whisper` event in the `MemoryTrace` contract represent thematically?

> A) A gas usage log  
> B) A message broadcast from a ghost or lost consciousness  
> C) A function for minting NFTs  
> D) An error thrown during a transaction

---

### 🧬 2. Why does the contract store `msg.sender` as `echo` during construction?

Reflect in 1–2 sentences:
> _Hint: What does it mean to be the “origin” of a digital echo?_

---

### 🪞 3. What would happen if someone other than the original `echo` account called `callOut()`?

> A) The contract would reject the call  
> B) A new message would overwrite the last  
> C) The contract would self-destruct  
> D) Only `echo` can call any function in the contract

---

### 💫 4. In your own words, how does the contract `MemoryTrace` simulate the idea of a ghost trying to communicate?

Short answer (1–3 sentences):  
> _Use emotion or logic here: why is event logging a good metaphor for haunting?_

---

### 🔐 5. Bonus Brain-Twist:  
If Echo’s ghost wanted to hide a message in plain sight for someone else to find, how might they use `callOut()` and `event Whisper` to do it?

Describe a creative use case or metaphor below:
> _e.g. Hiding clues in transaction logs, like a digital séance or breadcrumb trail._

Score yourself gently—this quiz is more about narrative logic and deeper understanding than perfect answers.

🌀 *"We are the echoes of intent. What we whisper becomes the next block in time."*
