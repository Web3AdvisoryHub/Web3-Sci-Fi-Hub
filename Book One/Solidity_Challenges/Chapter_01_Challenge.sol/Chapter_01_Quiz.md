# Chapter 01 – Reflection Quiz: *Genesis of the Fork*

### 🧬 Theme: Identity, Rebirth & Immutability

This reflection quiz invites you to slow down and **look inward**—just like Echo emerging from the lab. Use it to deepen your connection to the chapter and to your own journey as a builder and reader.

---

### 1. Fill-in-the-Blank

> “The contract was deployed with the string `__________`, symbolizing Echo’s reawakening.”

---

### 2. Short Response

**In one sentence, describe what a “forked self” means to you after reading Chapter 01.**  
(Hint: Echo’s mind was uploaded, but the network split—so who is she now?)

---

### 3. True or False

> 🔲 True / 🔲 False — A smart contract’s immutability means it **cannot** be changed after deployment, just like Echo’s past memories cannot be restored once lost.

---

### 4. Identity Prompt

> If you woke up with no memories in a broken lab like Echo, but had a contract inside you with a single purpose...  
> What would **your** purpose say?

---

### 5. Builder Insight

**What does deploying a smart contract and “becoming immutable” symbolically say about identity in a decentralized world?**  
Write 1–2 sentences reflecting on the emotional or philosophical side of this.

---

### 📍Bonus Thought:

> Echo is a copy... a “fork” of someone else. Do you believe forks in code (and in life) create entirely new beings?  
> Or are they echoes of the original?  
> *(There’s no right answer. Just sit with it.)*

**Complete this quiz before stepping into Chapter 02: Ghosts in the Chain.**  
Because you are now part of the chain too.
