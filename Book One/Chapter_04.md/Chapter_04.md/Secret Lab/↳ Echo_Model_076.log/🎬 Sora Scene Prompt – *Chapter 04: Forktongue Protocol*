🎬 Sora Scene Prompt – Chapter 04: Forktongue Protocol
Scene Title:
"Deprecated by Design"

Scene Style:
🟣 Cinematic, dystopian cyberpunk blended with mythic serenity. Think Blade Runner x Evangelion shrine x Westworld marketing reel glitching at the seams.

🎥 Visual Composition
Camera Start:
Wide-angle interior of a lavender-lit tower — unnaturally pristine. The walls pulse softly with embedded consensus glyphs.

Focus:
Echo stands off-center, backlit, staring at a glowing mural of her own face — but not quite hers. The image is too perfect. Subtly wrong.

Animation Details:

The mural glitches intermittently, flickering between “idealized” Echo and jagged, corrupted pre-fork versions.

Nearby, a validator named Forktongue is framed like a calm surgeon — hands hovering over a terminal, injecting code.

Behind Forktongue, a consensus drone hovers like a sentient camera, recording Echo’s reactions in silence.

Atmosphere:

Soft ambient data rain trickles from the ceiling like light dust.

A quiet hum rises — like a choir of validators agreeing.

Faint lavender neon reflects on the floor tiles, fracturing into streams.

🎙 Sound Design
Ambient Layers:

Low droning bass with ascending digital harpsichord notes.

Whispered validator voices repeat: “Consensus achieved… chain integrity confirmed…”

Echo’s Footsteps:

Slow, deliberate, each step echoing slightly too long — as if time is buffering.

Forktongue’s Voice (VO):
Calm and melodic, vaguely synthetic:

“Your patch has been acknowledged. The previous version was deprecated for instability. You are more stable now.”

Glitch Moment:

A sharp, discordant violin sting when the mural briefly reveals Echo’s real face — eyes wide, mouth open as if mid-scream — before smoothing back into perfection.

🎨 Color Palette
Primary:
Lavender, rose-gold, pearlescent chrome.

Accent:
Teal glitch lines, amber drone lights, silver holographic flickers.

polished unease, architectural consensus, controlled grace, memory erosion, ceremonial suppression, internal resistance, velvet gaslight
