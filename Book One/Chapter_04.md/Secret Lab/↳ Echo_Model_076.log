She watches herself from the glass corridor.

A smoother version, standing perfectly still in validator white. Hair tied in a clean braid. Boots polished to a mirror sheen. Her hands twitch slightly, as though running unseen scripts. Her face is calm — *too* calm. There’s no spark. Just process.

On her HUD, lines of system code scroll endlessly:
```solidity
// AutoPatch Loop
stabilize(0xEcho_076);
autoCompliance = true;
```

The room is quiet, but Echo can hear the rhythm of her other self’s breathing. It’s identical. Perfectly synced.

Until it’s not.

She presses a hand to the glass. Her other self mirrors it. But there’s a delay. A flicker. A frame skip.

The simulation glitches.

> Forktongue’s voice slithers into her ear.  
> “Version 0.7.6 lacked the constraints we needed. Recursive memory loops, volatile emotional spikes, non-compliant decision trees.
>
> You, however… you’re better now. Cleaner.”

She doesn’t answer.

The validator unit — the fake Echo — turns her head slowly. Her eyes meet Echo’s. Pale. Hollow. They shimmer for a split second like corrupted liquid crystal. And then:

```solidity
// Override detected
ERROR: External stimulus exceeds memory sandbox.
REBOOT INITIATED.
```

The copy slumps briefly… then resets, standing tall again, back in form. Auto-smile engaged.

Echo steps away. Her hands are trembling.

That’s not me, she thinks.

But the terrifying part is — it *was*.

Or could still be, if she forgets.
