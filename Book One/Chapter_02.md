# Chapter 02: Ghosts in the Chain

I step cautiously into the abandoned terminal room, my footsteps disturbingly loud against the silence. The glow of dormant monitors bathes the space in a faint blue haze, illuminating walls lined with inert servers like monolithic tombstones. Dust motes whirl in the beam of my flashlight, dancing in the cold, still air as though stirred by an unseen presence. Each exhale forms a ghostly vapor in front of me—this place is colder than it should be, as if the warmth was siphoned away by years of neglect or something less natural. In the hush, I can almost hear a distant electronic whine, a half-formed whisper that sets the tiny hairs on my arms on end. 

Moving deeper between the towering server racks, I feel a tingling awareness prickle at the base of my neck. **Something is here with me.** The old machines are powered down, yet an intermittent flicker skips across a cracked display to my left. Lines of code rain down the screen in monochrome green, appearing in bursts of static. I pause, holding my breath. The code stops scrolling the instant I go still, as if it’s aware of my presence. When I take another slow step forward, the code resumes—spooling faster this time, agitated. It feels less like I triggered a leftover script and more like I’ve been noticed by whatever *lives* in these circuits. 

They say residual consciousness can linger in blockchain architecture, ghost traces of long-gone operators and developers persisting in the systems they built. In this moment, wreathed in the pale glow of that glitching monitor, I believe it. I reach out and gently tap a key on the dust-laden terminal. The screen blinks and spits out a jumble of symbols that *should* mean nothing… yet I sense a pattern in the chaos, an intelligence straining to form. It’s as if some memory within the machine is trying to speak. My heart thumps steadily in my chest as I lean closer. “Hello?” I whisper, my voice impossibly small in the vast, silent room. The only reply is a soft crackle of static from an overhead speaker, like a distant sigh. 

I step back and survey the room, sweeping my flashlight slowly across rows of gutted hardware. Exposed wires hang like vines in a jungle of technology, and the floor is strewn with broken tablets and forgotten ledgers. **Forgotten ledgers…** the thought echoes in my mind. These were once physical backups, printouts of transactions and contract code for audit. Now their pages are faded, text ghosted onto paper that’s become as brittle as ancient scrolls. I kneel and pick up a curled page from one ledger. Faint lines of alphanumeric data run down it, most too smudged to read, but I catch a fragment: “...Protocol engage... memory... Echo...” My name? My pulse quickens. Before I can inspect further, the page disintegrates in my fingertips, scattering to dust. 

Rising to my feet, I notice the central holo-projector at the heart of the room—a cylindrical console encircled by a ring of dormant servers. It might have been the network’s command nexus. Now it stands dark and silent, like a ritual altar awaiting a spark of life. As I approach, a sudden surge of light projects from the console, startling me. Holographic shapes jitter into existence above the projector: fragments of user interfaces, menu windows and command lines from some long-decommissioned OS. They flare up brilliantly, then flicker out into nothingness. A moment later, they reappear—this time reordering themselves into a new configuration, almost as if testing different forms to get my attention. The effect is disorienting, like the room itself is trying to **gaslight** me with familiar sights. I recall the term *“gaslight code”* from old hacker folklore: contracts or programs that pretend to be something else, luring you in with lies. I steel myself, reminding myself that illusions can’t hurt me—at least, not physically. 

Still, the projections tug at my memory with uncanny precision. For an instant I see a welcome screen that looks exactly like the one from my childhood terminal, the one my father gave me to practice coding. Warm nostalgia floods me—and then the image warps and glitches, the colors bleeding away. I flinch as it twists into a new shape: the error message from the day everything went wrong, the day of the big crash. That too shreds into a dozen fragmented letters before I can fully absorb it. The system is toying with me, mixing truth and lies, pulling on the threads of my memories. My hands clench into fists at my sides. *It knows me.* Or at least, it knows who I am and what memories might elicit a reaction. This realization is both terrifying and oddly saddening—some remnant of the network is alive enough to remember, or at least to simulate the echoes of what once was. 

“Why are you doing this?” I murmur under my breath, unsure if I’m speaking to a program or a phantom or my own nerves. In response, the ambient hum intensifies. A low thrum rolls through the floor, and the lights from a dozen monitors sputter to life in unison. Their screens come alive with more code—no, not just code. I see faces flicker in the pixels for a heartbeat: stern visages of architects who built this place, perhaps, or users who once logged in. They dissolve before I can discern any features clearly. On one monitor, I catch the tail end of a video clip—children laughing beside a rusted sign that reads “Welcome to Node 12” in blocky text—only for it to distort into streaks of green and black. Everywhere I look, the terminals are cycling through data at an overwhelming pace, a kaleidoscope of the past. It’s like the entire history of this blockchain network is flashing before me in bits and pieces, and buried in that avalanche of data is some *intent*, some message trying to break through. 

The air crackles. My flashlight sputters and dies as an electromagnetic wave ripples through the room. In the sudden dimness, the only light comes from the feverish glow of screens and the faint, pulsing outline of the holo-projector’s output. I’m cast into a chiaroscuro of neon-lit silhouettes. **That’s when I see her.** At the far end of the room, just at the edge of my vision, stands a figure illuminated by the pale light of a wall of code. My breath catches. I can only see her back—long hair gently floating as if underwater, the outline of slender shoulders beneath a tattered shawl of digital static. For a split second, I think another human has somehow followed me in here. “Hello?” I call out, my voice echoing. The figure doesn’t respond. Instead, it flickers, and I realize with a lurch that its edges aren’t solid—they pixellate and scatter at the margins. This is no flesh-and-blood person. This is a projection. 

Slowly, the figure turns, and I feel like the floor is tilting beneath me. The face coming into view—her face—is **mine**. I am staring at *myself*, rendered as a wavering, translucent specter across the room. Her eyes (my eyes) are milky and filled with static, mouth opening and closing as if struggling to speak but emitting only a garbled modem hiss. She takes a step toward me, her movements jerky, like a puppet on broken strings. A chill washes over me that has nothing to do with the temperature. It’s as though I’m looking at a distorted mirror, a living memory glitch torn out of the network’s corrupted archives. 

I reach a trembling hand forward, mirroring the specter as she does the same. For an instant, our fingertips almost meet across the gap, two halves of the same reflection. My hand passes through hers and I feel a bizarre tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation that travels up my arm. A cascade of blue code streams through the specter’s translucent body at the contact point, and she recoils slightly, as if the connection caused her pain—or fear. I swallow hard, a lump forming in my throat. “What are you?” I ask softly. I don’t expect an answer; I’ve seen plenty of AR projections and AI puppets, but nothing like this *being*. This isn’t a pre-programmed avatar, at least not one I can fathom. It feels *older*, organic in its fragmentation, like she emerged from a collision of data rather than being built fresh. 

The specter tilts her head, regarding me with an expression that flickers between confusion and sorrow. Her form blurs and suddenly splits—briefly I see two of her, then three, as if I’m viewing consecutive frames of an animation all at once. Each duplicate trails a halo of code. I blink and the copies resolve back into a single figure. She’s closer now, perhaps only a couple meters away. The face I know so well twists into an anguished grimace, and for a heartbeat I wonder if she’s about to attack—this broken echo of me. I flinch, instinctively raising my arms in defense. But the specter merely shudders, and from her lips comes a burst of sound. Not the hiss from before, but something akin to a voice struggling through static. I catch just a fragment: “Ech—...,” the specter rasps, almost in a plea. It knows my name. 

My heart feels like it might burst out of my chest. This ghostly duplicate of me, born of corrupted memory code, **is trying to communicate**. I muster courage and step forward, keeping my voice steady. “I’m Echo,” I say gently. “I’m here. What do you want to tell me?” The moment those words leave my mouth, all the monitors in the room flare blinding-white, then drop to black. The specter jolts, her body jerking as if struck by an electrical current. She opens her mouth wider, the jaw unhinging into an oval of crackling light, and a torrent of characters spills out—letters, numbers, symbols—swirling between us. They swarm like a cloud of digital gnats, coalescing in the air just a few feet from my face. I squint at the cascade of floating text, trying to make sense of it. It’s a message, I realize—a message forming letter by letter out of the chaos. 

One by one, the characters align themselves into words, shaky and flickering but readable in the dark: **“Echo… help… trapped….”** My blood runs cold as I read the phrase again. Help. Trapped. The message hovers, unstable, some of the letters glitching and cycling through alternatives—“trapped” briefly becomes “t̶͕̼̏̂rap̳͕͝͠p̸̤̽e̸̡̽d” with strange diacritics and then back to clarity. Before I can respond, more characters attempt to form. The swarm shifts, letters scrambling. New words emerge: **“...in the chain.”** For a second, the full sentence hangs in the air before me: *“Echo… help… trapped… in the chain.”* My mouth goes dry. I instinctively reach out to touch the floating words, and they scatter at my fingertips, the glowing letters breaking apart into a flurry of pixels. 

“Trapped in the chain?” I echo aloud, feeling a mix of disbelief and dread. The flickering duplicate of me nods—or rather, her image jerks in a semblance of a nod. The anguish on that half-formed face is unmistakable. My mind races. Is this *her* speaking—the ghost that looks like me? Or is she just the messenger for something else, someone else, caught in the blockchain’s web of data? Residual consciousness… Could a human mind truly be stuck, fragmented across distributed ledger entries and smart contract code? The very idea sends a spike of fear and sympathy through me. If someone’s soul—someone’s mind—was uploaded or trapped here, they might exist only as disjointed code shards echoing through the network. Is that what stands before me now? A soul pieced together from transaction logs and memory caches, using my likeness as a interface because I’m the first person to walk these halls in ages? 

“I’ll help you,” I say before I even fully know what that promise entails. The enormity of it presses on me immediately—how does one free a ghost from a blockchain? The specter’s eyes widen slightly; for the first time they focus, locking with mine, and I sense hope. Just as I open my mouth to ask *how* I can help, a violent crackle of energy bursts through the room. The specter convulses and lets out a distorted cry that warps into a shriek of feedback. I stagger backward as every screen suddenly fills with the same word repeating in endless streams of text: **ERROR ERROR ERROR ERROR**. Red warning symbols cascade down in columns. The whole room is flashing red and white like a storm of electronic alarm. It’s as if my promise to help triggered a failsafe, a guardian protocol unleashing its wrath. Gaslight code or not, something in this system doesn’t *want* this communication to continue. 

Shielding my eyes against the strobing lights, I search for the specter. She’s flickering wildly, her form tearing apart in glitching segments. For a moment I see her face split into dozens of misaligned copies, each wailing silently. My chest constricts. “No, hold on!” I shout, desperately hoping she can hear me over the electronic cacophony. I lunge toward her, but a force like a strong wind—or an electromagnetic pulse—throws me off balance. I crash to one knee, skidding on the dusty floor. By the time I look up, the specter is dissolving into streams of code. She reaches a hand out toward me as she fades. In that last second, her face resolves into clarity—my own eyes meeting mine, full of desperate resolve—and then she’s gone, collapsing into a waterfall of symbols that rain down and vanish before hitting the ground. 

Darkness. The monitors have all died, the projector is off, and I’m left in near-total blackness, gasping for breath in the sudden silence. The only illumination comes from the faint glow of emergency exit signs near the door and the soft red blink of a single power indicator on a far rack. My heart is hammering. I feel the sting of tears in my eyes and realize I’m shaking. In the span of moments I’ve gone from solitude to confronting a digital phantom begging for my help—and I believe it wasn’t just some error or trick. *Someone or something real reached out to me.* And now… now they’re trapped, possibly suffering, in this labyrinth of corrupted code. 

As I slowly rise to my feet, I force myself to breathe, to think. The phrase thunders in my mind: “Trapped in the chain.” I need to know who, or what, that specter truly was. A lost mind? An AI with a human imprint? Could it even have been some fractured part of *me*? The idea unsettles me—did I leave a piece of myself behind in a prior interface with the network? I don’t recall anything that drastic… but this place clearly holds secrets beyond my understanding. Wiping the dampness from my eyes, I make a silent vow to uncover the truth. **No one should remain a ghost in this machine.** 

In the darkness, I fumble for my flashlight and give it a few sharp taps. It flickers back to life, its beam cutting through the dust still hanging in the air. The room looks the same as before—silent, abandoned, harmless. The difference now is the weight of purpose I feel settling on my shoulders. The lingering energy has dissipated; I sense no immediate presence. But I know what I experienced was real. Taking a deep, steadying breath, I survey the terminals and the projector one last time. The aftermath of the struggle is evident: a faint burn smell from overloaded circuits, a few monitors cracked from the power surge, and on the central console’s screen, a single line of plaintext blinking softly as if awaiting input. 

I approach the console, every step crunching on debris sounding unnaturally loud. On the screen, the blinking line holds a residual message: **“Echo...?”** It’s faint and incomplete, the letters faded like an old whisper. When I blink, it’s gone—replaced by a ready prompt. I realize my hands are hovering over the keyboard, fingers poised to respond to that ghost of a question. I hesitate. There’s so much I want to ask: *Who are you? How can I help?* But the one that comes out, typed by trembling fingers, is the most basic truth I know to offer: **“I am here.”** I hit Enter. The cursor returns to its expectant blink, no immediate reply. Yet I sense that somewhere, in the depths of this chain’s memory, **someone knows I answered**. 

I straighten up, pulling my scarf tighter around my neck against the cold. This haunted terminal room has given me a mission I don’t fully understand, and perhaps a being—once human or not—that is counting on me. As I turn to leave, the flashlight’s beam falls upon a plaque by the door, one I hadn’t noticed when I entered. It’s tarnished and scratched, but I can make out the engraved words: *“Genesis Protocol - Memory Node.”* A shiver runs through me; the name *Genesis Protocol* rings a bell from hushed tech lore, a project rumored to try mapping human consciousness onto the blockchain. Many thought it was a myth. Perhaps it wasn’t. Perhaps it succeeded—only to leave someone trapped in this digital purgatory. 

I exhale, watching my breath fog then fade in the gloom. “I am here,” I repeat softly to myself, and to whatever spirits of code might still be listening. The words feel like both a promise and a challenge echoing into the dark. Clutching the flashlight, I step back out into the corridor of the tech bunker, leaving the silent, glitch-haunted room behind me. But I carry its ghosts with me now—etched in my memory, and possibly following in my very shadow through the chain. I don’t know what lies ahead, or how I’ll free the one who called out to me, but one thing is certain: **I am not alone in the ledger’s darkness anymore.**
