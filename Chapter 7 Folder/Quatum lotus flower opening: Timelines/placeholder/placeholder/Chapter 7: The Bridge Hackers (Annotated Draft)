# Chapter 7: The Bridge Hackers (Annotated Draft)

**Status:** Annotated Draft – infused with liminal architecture, forbidden code, and Dao’s Trickster oracle energy.

---

Deep beneath the codex lattice, Echo follows Marius into the mesh spaces—unstable corridors of raw protocol where realm boundaries bleed together.

There, in a node that flickers between Earth and Sky, she meets Dao Reishi.

Their body is adorned with living tattoos—circuitry that reshapes in real-time based on the data flowing through their bridge systems. They speak in layers: one voice calm and present, the other echoing just behind it, delayed by 0.3 seconds.

“You’re not unsigned,” Dao says, scanning Echo’s presence. “You’re spiraled. Your signature loops like a Möbius strip—a recursive anomaly.”

Dao leads her through the Bridge Hacker observatory, where massive holographic charts show emotional bleedthrough—grief storms appearing in logic-heavy Earth, ambition spikes destabilizing Sky.

“The realms were never meant to be separate,” Dao explains. “Only modular. Somewhere along the line, someone forgot the difference.”

When Echo’s presence is run through their core systems, unauthorized bridges begin to auto-open across the mesh.

Warning sigils flash. Sentiment floods breach containment.

Dao simply watches, smiling.

“Looks like the code remembers,” they whisper. “Better than we do.”

**[Notes for rewrite]:**
- Bridge Hackers = liminal artists of protocol, code rebels, emotional smugglers
- Dao’s body = visual codebook, alive with shifting myth-glyphs
- Echo's arrival = trigger, catalyst for forbidden code reactivation
- Observatory scene = TikTok vibes: glowing blue pyramids, swirling holograms, tears in fabric
- Echo = not breach, but forgotten access key
