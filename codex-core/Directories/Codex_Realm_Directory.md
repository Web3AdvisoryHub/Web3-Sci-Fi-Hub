**Type:** Dynamic Realm Listing + Navigation Hub  
**Purpose:** Publicly display all Builder and Lore Realms that can be visited, previewed, or requested ‚Äî forming the core travel layer of the Codex universe.

## üåå What Is the Realm Directory?

The **Codex Realm Directory** is a visual and searchable listing of all:
- Builder-created realms
- Codex-official lore realms
- Invite-only or unlocked scroll-gated regions

It works like a cosmic travel board ‚Äî where Dorm holders or guests can discover new worlds and request access.

|-------|-------------|
| Realm Name | Title chosen by Builder |
| Affinity | Realm theme (Ocean, Glitch, Flame, etc) |

| Motto | Required quote from Realm Scroll |
| Access Type | Public / Invite Only / Mentor-Only |
| Quests | Number of scrolls/paths available |

## üîì Access Logic
