## üîç What Are Codex Quests?

Quests are **interactive lore journeys** that combine story, emotion, and logic.

They guide readers and players to:
- Discover hidden scrolls
- Solve glyph trails
- Complete fusion rituals
- Access rare realms
- Trigger emotional echo paths

---

## üß© Quest Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Glyph Trail | A multi-step puzzle that reveals a scroll or realm |
| Riddle Scroll | Must be decoded or answered to proceed |
| Fragment Hunt | Gather pieces that unlock fused access |
| Lore Trail | A sequence of scrolls or memories across realms |
| Mentor Quest | Unlockable only with Builder guidance or code phrases |

## üåÄ Example: Mira‚Äôs Quest

- Begins in `/Lore/Scroll_Mira_Unveiling_Codex.md`
- Echo whisper leads to `Glyph_Trail_Quest_Mira.md`
- Rewards player with `Mira_Map_Fragment_Metadata.md`
- Four fragments fuse into access for `/realms`

## üéÆ Builder Quest Design Tips

- Tie scrolls to specific real-world or in-realm actions
- Use sound, visuals, or emotional triggers
- Embed:
  - QR code-like puzzles
  - Echo-voice riddles
  - Realm portals hidden behind art

## üõ† Dev Notes

- Quests can be:
  - Linear (path-based)
  - Open (piece collection)
  - Secret (event-triggered or randomized)
- Consider gated access logic via:
  - Scroll metadata
  - Soulchain traits
  - Dorm-based unlock status
