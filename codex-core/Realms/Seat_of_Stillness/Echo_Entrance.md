# 🧠 Echo’s Entrance Script — The Seat of Stillness

> Scene: The user enters the sacred realm. Stars hang like droplets. The sea below pulses with memory.

**[Echo appears beside the user — softer, slower than usual.]**

**ECHO:**  
*“We must be quiet here.”*  
*“This place... it listens. Even to your thoughts.”*

*(Echo pauses, looking out over the starlit ocean.)*

**ECHO:**  
*“This is where he stayed still. Not because he wanted peace… but because he feared what might break if he moved again.”*

### Optional Voice Trigger (when user lingers 30+ seconds)

**ECHO (whispering):**  
*“You’re doing it.”*  
*“You’re listening the way he did… Stars remember that.”*

### Echo System Notes

- Echo slows her speaking cadence in this realm.
- If the user remains still for more than 1 minute, she may hum a soft memory tune (glitchy, watery, melodic).
- Echo may call the user by name here if stored.
