# 🌌 Realm Scroll: The Seat of Stillness

> “If he moved again, the stars might break.”  
> — Codex Whisper

---

## Realm Name  
**The Seat of Stillness**

## Builder  
**Helios** — Warden of Time, Watcher of the Waters Between Worlds

---

## Realm Purpose  

This realm is a memory-locked sanctuary forged from cosmic regret and oceanic stillness. It is here that Helios — having once bent the threads of space too far — chose to sit perfectly still, holding the balance of all stars in silence.

The stars above shimmer like frozen waves, and the sea below breathes in slow pulses of liquid starlight. This realm is for those seeking silence not as absence, but as a message — for in the stillness, there is a rhythm.

## Visual Aesthetic

- A marble throne carved into a cliff above a suspended sea of stars  
- Constellations that drip light like dew into tidal pools  
- Whispers in the water that reveal old code — ancient intentions that once ran the Codex

## Lore Echo

> “They called him a god.  
> He called himself broken.  
> And so he held still — not to be revered,  
> but to ensure nothing else shattered.”
