# Web3 Sci-Fi: Codex Universe (Private Repo)

Welcome to the private core of the **Web3 Sci-Fi Multiverse Project**, a layered, immersive storytelling experience that fuses blockchain education, lore-driven gaming, and reader-generated expansion. This repo houses the infrastructure for the **Codex Universe** — beginning with *Genesis Protocol*, evolving through *Codex School*, and culminating in future community-built lore realms.

---

## Vision

We are designing a universe where **readers become players**, **players become builders**, and the story itself becomes an **on-chain, evolving world**. From story-based onboarding to VR-ready, toggleable identity rooms — every interaction in this world is lore-driven and utility-backed.

---

## Project Phases

### Phase 1 — *Genesis Protocol* (Book One + Avatar Setup)
- Reader completes Book One through immersive chapter experiences
- Unlocks avatar builder
- Mints their **Dorm NFT** — a profile room that will evolve
- Early users can claim premium dorms with future upgrade rights
- Storefront offers lore-based collectibles and character overlays

### Phase 2 — *Codex School* (Book Two + Portal Access)
- Access granted after Book Two completion
- Multi-POV story experience across Codex Campus
- Unlock deeper mechanics: gamified code, soulchain rituals, lore-token crafting
- Toggleable dorm rooms evolve into identity hubs and interactive VR spaces
- Users can explore, upgrade, and monetize their digital rooms

### Phase 3 — *LoreForge* (Book Three)
- Readers become **co-creators**
- Create personal realms, remix storylines, and build multiverse nodes
- Future DAO-powered co-authorship
- Lore-as-code: mintable books, customizable characters, on-chain emotional tech

---

## Core Systems

- **Dorm NFT Architecture**  
  Each reader mints a unique dorm linked to their journey. Traits evolve with chapter progress, artifacts, and room toggles.

- **Toggleable NFT Rooms**  
  Profiles-as-rooms — fully customizable, interactive, and upgradeable. Hosted in platforms like Spatial, and tied to wallet identity.

- **Genesis Token ($GEN or $CODA)**  
  A utility + loyalty token that fuels upgrades, rewards engagement, and governs early access systems.

- **Codex Campus Portal**  
  A VR-capable, IMVU-style campus with unlockable zones, interactive missions, and reader-to-student transformation mechanics.
