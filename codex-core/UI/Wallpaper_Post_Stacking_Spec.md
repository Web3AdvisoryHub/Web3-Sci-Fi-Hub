# 🧱 Wallpaper Post Stacking & Shrine System

## ✨ What Is Post Stacking?

A social mechanic unique to the Wallpaper Feed:  
**Posts can be physically stacked** — turning into visual totems, emotional shrines, or “memory statues” of your journey.

---

### 🌀 Core Behaviors

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Drag one post onto another | Creates a “stack” — a totem of scrolls |
| Stack high enough | Forms a glowing **Post Shrine** with aura |
| Click a shrine | Opens a full **scrollable timeline** of every post inside |
| Repost a shrine | Entire stack is cloned + original receives credit |
| Remove a post | Extract it from the stack — optional monetization |

---

### 📚 Shrine Timeline

- Every stack has a **chronological memory feed**  
- Viewers can scroll through the original thoughts that built the shrine  
- Builders may **hide** or **highlight** entries  
- Echo may whisper lore once a shrine reaches 7+ layers

---

## 💰 Shrine Economics

- Shrines can be monetized as **post collections**
- Builders earn fees from:
  - Shrine reposts
  - Shrine digs (see below)
  - Shrine sticker reactions

---

## 🪓 Digging + Loot Logic

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Visitor “digs” shrine | Pays fee in $GEN — gets top post as NFT |
| Shrine collapses | Builder loses that visual stack |
| Builder paid | Rewarded for artistry + value at risk |
| Digger warned | 10 digs = Source Strike risk (see next scroll) |

---

## ♻️ Trash or Repost Logic

- Clicking shrine opens a **dig or delete** option
- Trash can appears: throw away old scrolls = compost energy
- Repost dead scrolls = rebirth (new skin, new price)

---

## 🌱 Emotional Play

- Shrine stacking = visible journey of identity  
- Echo reacts to emotional combinations:
  - “Anger Tower”
  - “Grief Mountain”
  - “Dream Pillar”
- Shrine seeds may unlock scroll portals or realm quests
