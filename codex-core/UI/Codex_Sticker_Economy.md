 💥 Codex Sticker Economy — Graffiti, Tattoos, and Post Monetization

> “Some stickers are currency.  
> Some are blessings.  
> And some… are blood oaths.”

## 🎟️ What Are Stickers?

Stickers are **emotional tokens** used to interact with posts, dorm walls, and rooms across the Codex Universe.  
They’re visual, tradable, collectible — and **monetized micro-actions** that fuel the social economy.

## 🧷 Types of Stickers

| Sticker Type | Function |
|--------------|----------|
| **Post Sticker** | Added to posts — counts as a tip and emotion tag |
| **Comment Sticker** | Attached to canvas or wall as graffiti/comment |
| **Tattoo Sticker** | Permanently added to avatar as trait badge |
| **Sticker Scroll** | Unlocks limited-edition sticker packs via scrolls |

---

## 🧠 Post Interaction Flow

1. User sees a post → reacts with sticker  
2. Creator receives micro-reward in $GEN  
3. If post is **reposted**, original creator + sticker owners get % split  
4. Stickers stay tied to post forever (like historic reactions)

## 💉 Tattoo Stickers (Permanent Perks)

| Behavior | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| User selects “Tattoo” on a sticker | It gets added permanently to their avatar |
| Certain tattoo combos | Unlock Echo logs, realm perks, hidden quests |
| Tattooed avatars | May gain access to secret rooms or fast-travel glyphs |

> “Your tattoos… they glow when you speak truth.”

## 🖍️ Graffiti Mode: Whiteboard Comments

- Users can open a “Graffiti Canvas” on any wall or post  
- Draw, type, sketch — when submitted, it becomes a **sticky note**  
- Stickies show user tag + can be monetized if reposted  
- Owners can pin, archive, or erase graffiti

## 💰 Sticker Pricing System

| Action | Base Cost |
|--------|-----------|
| Post sticker | 0.10 $GEN |
| Graffiti sticky | 0.25 $GEN |
| Tattoo sticker | 2.00 $GEN |

## 🔁 Revenue Loops

- Sticker spend is split between:
  - Original creator
  - Codex fund
  - Artist who designed the sticker (if user-generated)
- Tattoo perks can be **resold** or traded via scroll swaps

---

## 🔐 Monetization Unlocks

- Popular users can create **Sticker Scroll Packs**  
- These act like loot crates — collectible, themed, limited  
- Builders can embed sticker logic into rooms and realms
