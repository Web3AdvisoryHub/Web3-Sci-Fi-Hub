# 🧠 Codex UI User Flow (Web2-Friendly)

**Goal:** Make the Codex onboarding experience intuitive, cinematic, and emotionally guided — even for users with zero Web3 knowledge.

---

## ✨ Overall Tone

- Feels like: a magical onboarding experience, not an app
- UX anchored in story: “You are stepping into your own tale”
- Soft-glitch aesthetic, ambient sounds, Echo narration

---

## 🌀 Step-by-Step Flow

### 1. **Landing Page** → `Wake the Chain`
- Echo speaks: “Are you ready to wake the chain?”
- Button: “Begin”
- NO wallet required yet

### 2. **Email Entry / Book Code Unlock**
- Prompt: “Did you receive a book or a scroll code?”
- User enters code (printed in back of book)
- Email collected for future ticket if needed
- Confirmation: “Your portal is waking…”

### 3. **Avatar Preview / Realm Tease**
- User previews avatar styles: Pixel, Sims, BasePaint
- Click “Choose later” or “Start building now”
- Echo explains: “Your form will reflect your journey”

### 4. **Reading Portal or Chapter Hub**
- Read Book One online or upload scroll codes
- Story progress tracked in local storage + linked wallet if desired

### 5. **Dorm Activation (optional)**
- “You’ve earned the right to mint your Codex Dorm”
- Dorm = personal room + profile + upgrade station
- Wallet connect triggered only here
- Mint for free (if golden ticket) or pay in $GEN

### 6. **Codex School Access**
- Unlocks `/campus`
- Echo now appears as in-world guide
- Player can view other rooms, join quests, enter Mirror Garden, etc.
