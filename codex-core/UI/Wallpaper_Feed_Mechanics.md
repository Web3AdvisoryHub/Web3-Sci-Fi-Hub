## 🖼 Feed Style Overview

- **Type:** 2D infinite scrollable canvas (not just vertical)
- **Look:** Mixed-media scrapbook + sticky note board + constellation map
- **Feel:** Interactive notebook with layering, zooming, and collage styling

---

## 📜 Core Mechanics

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Scroll Direction | 360° canvas — scroll up, down, left, right |
| Layered Posting | Posts can stack (make statues) or tile horizontally |
| Emotional Tags | Color-coded feelings tied to each post |
| Time Decay | Older posts fade unless pinned or reshared |
| Public vs Private | Posting on Wallpaper = public and lootable |
| Canvas Status | Changes with mood (color fades, music shifts, glow on joy, static on sorrow) |

---

## 🔍 Interaction Options

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Click Icon | View image, video, or deep note |
| Hover Post | Preview mood (color/emoji shifts) |
| Zoom Out | See constellation layout of posts |
| Stack Post | Create sculpture/statue effect |
| Repost | Moves post to your zone, tracks lineage |
| Dig | Attempt to uncover buried post (costs $GEN) |

---

## 🌍 Wallpaper Zones

- Users walk/drive across feed in game mode  
- Posts may form paths, mazes, or trails  
- Trash appears as grime after 3 days uncleaned  
- Troll Zones are marked by distortion/flicker  
- Users can “claim land” via post stacking

---

## 💡 Monetization Features

| Mechanic | $GEN Flow |
|----------|-----------|
| Posting | Optional fee for highlight status |
| Loot Drops | Triggered by troll strikes |
| Janitor Work | Cleaning earns micro-fees |
| Emotional Post Match | Rare tag combos earn bonuses |
| Post Resale | If a post becomes viral, OG gets cut from reposts |

## 🧠 Lore Echo

> You walk through it.  
> You live inside it.”
