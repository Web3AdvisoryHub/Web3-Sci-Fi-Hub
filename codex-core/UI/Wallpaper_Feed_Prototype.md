## ✨ What Is the Wallpaper Feed?

The **Wallpaper Feed** is a free-scroll, 2D canvas-based social layer that acts as the **prototyping ground for Toggle** — designed to feel like you're walking through a collage of ideas, scrolls, stickers, and dreams.

It’s part feed, part scrapbook, part digital gallery.  
Players post to their dorm wall, then choose whether to display that post on the **Wallpaper Map** — a shared memory canvas where everyone can scroll and explore.

## 🌀 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **2D Free Scroll** | Unlike vertical feeds, users can scroll in any direction — diagonally, zoom, pan |
| **Collage Style** | Feels like a scrapbook wall with mixed media: polaroids, sticky notes, pixel doodles |
| **Repost Logic** | You can repost anything you see by placing it somewhere new on the map |
| **Sticky Notes** | Users can write, draw, or paste commentary that sticks near the original post |
| **Zoom Reveal** | As you zoom in, post details, creator tags, and sticker interactions appear |
| **Canvas Comments** | Comments are handwritten notes, emojis, or small sticker reactions |
| **Room Integration** | Every post can link back to a user's dorm — expanding the canvas into their realm |

## 🪞 Aesthetic Goals

- Looks like **real paper** layered over a glowing map  
- Posts flutter slightly, with **scroll echoes** when hovered  
- Doodles and tape edges animate lightly, like memories trying to stay stuck  
- Echo occasionally adds glowing glyph hints across the map

## 🧩 Early Toggle Prototype

Toggle will evolve into a structured, vertical social feed.  
Wallpaper is the **unfiltered layer of imagination**, where post discovery is artistic, nonlinear, and full of lore.

## 💸 Monetization Hooks

- Stickers used on reposts share rev with original creator  
- Reposts = micro-mintable collectibles (optional toggle)  
- Comments with value (e.g., viral) can earn scroll placement rewards  
- Posts can become scrolls after enough interactions (like going “epic”)

## 🌟 Future Upgrades

- Scroll-tagged search overlays  
- Location-based feed (like rooms forming constellations)  
- VR and handheld support for immersive doodle-posting
