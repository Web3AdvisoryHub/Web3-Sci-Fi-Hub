## üöô Traversal Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ü•æ Walking | Slow, guided, click-to-move |
| üõπ Hoverboard | Fast, stylized traversal (earned or bought) |
| üöó Vehicle | Custom rides (paper planes, carts, brooms, etc) |
| ü™Ñ Magic Carpet | Rare Builder reward ‚Äî cross canvas with shimmer trails |

## üßπ Trashcan Logic

- Posts left unclicked/undug for **3 days** decay into **grimy versions**
- When walked or driven over, gain tire tracks or footprints
- Posts can be **dragged to trashcan** by other players (cleanup action)
- Janitors get micro-$GEN per trash clear

### Trash Conditions

| Trigger | Result |
|---------|--------|
| Unclicked post (3+ days) | Dims + adds ‚Äúdust‚Äù layer |
| Troll Mess | Glitched post fragments spread across canvas |
| Duplicate Spam | Auto-tagged for Trash Review |
| Community Flagged | Voted into trash tier until reviewed |

---

## üóëÔ∏è Cleanup Tools

| Tool | Use |
|------|-----|
| Dustpan | 1-post sweep |
| Mop | Medium radius clean |
| Broom Hover | Speed clean tool |
| Street Cleaner Truck | Guild-level clean sweep (multi-zone)

---

## ‚ú® Monetization Loop

- Trash cleared = rewards janitor ($GEN)
- Troll mess = opportunity for collection + defense
- Clean zones = boost your builder visibility
- Unlock ‚ÄúClean Streak‚Äù badge after 100 cleanups
