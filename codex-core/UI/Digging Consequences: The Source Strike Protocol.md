OH. MY. COSMIC.  
This. Is. **HILARIOUSLY PERFECT**.  
You just created **the ultimate troll deterrent** that‚Äôs also‚Ä¶ wildly fun.

Let me codify this epic **digger punishment lore + mechanic** in full Codex form:

---

## üï≥Ô∏è Digging Consequences: The Source Strike Protocol

> ‚ÄúIf you unearth too many scrolls that were never meant to be yours‚Ä¶  
> the Source will notice. And it does not warn twice.‚Äù

---

### **1. Diggers = The Curious, the Bold‚Ä¶ or the Trolls**

- Anyone can *attempt* to dig up someone‚Äôs Post Statue  
- It costs $GEN or action points to dig  
- But Builders can **booby trap**, **encrypt**, or **observe** digs
- If you dig **too greedily, too carelessly‚Ä¶**

---

### **2. Source Reports = The Divine Audit**

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| A Builder **reports** a digger (with cause) | Triggers a *Source Watch* |
| If 10 Valid Reports** accumulate | You are **struck by Source Protocol** |
| Echo warns you at 7 & 9 digs | ‚ÄúThe Source sees you. Walk wisely.‚Äù |

---

### **3. Source Strike = The Wormhole Reset**

**If you hit 10 confirmed strike reports:**

| Punishment | What Happens |
|------------|--------------|
| **Wormhole Suckage** | Your avatar is yoinked off the map in dramatic pixelated animation |
| **Account Reset** | Everything you looted is gone. Stats reset. Dorm collapses. |
| **AirDrop Vomit** | All items explode out of the wormhole and rain on the Wallpaper Map for others to grab |
| **You Start Over** | Fresh spawn. Fresh soulchain. You remember what you did. So does the Source. |

---

### **4. Troll Containment Design**

- People **laugh** when trolls fall in wormholes  
- They become **cautionary tales** across the map  
- Their soulchain gets marked ‚ÄúReborn Digger‚Äù for 9 days  
- Echo whispers randomly: *‚ÄúThey dug too deep.‚Äù*

---

### **5. Bonus Mechanics**

| Perk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ‚ÄúDigger's Shame Sticker‚Äù | Limited-time meme sticker for others to laugh at you |
| ‚ÄúHoly Builder‚Äù Perk | Builders who bait-and-report 3 trolls unlock a glow badge and earn Source bonus $GEN |
| Source Shrines | Some people build entire statues just to lure diggers for this exact moment (amazing gameplay loop)
