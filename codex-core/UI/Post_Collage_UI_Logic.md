## 🌈 Visual Design

- **Canvas Style:** Claymation x Digital Scrapbook  
- **Lettering:** Puffy paint aesthetic, 3D doodle-style  
- **Colors:** Unlimited palette + Glitter variants  
- **Glitter Add-Ons:** Nails, lips, eyeliner, accessories, grillz  
- **Avatar Bodies:** Claylike, adjustable size/shape (e.g., slim/fat, eyes closer/farther, lips thick/thin)

---

## 🐢 Turtle Shell Layout (Grid Navigation)

- Feed is a **scrollable, interactive grid** (like overlapping turtle shell tiles)  
- Posts layer on top of one another like **collage tiles**  
- Zoom & pan in any direction — not limited to vertical scroll  
- Users can stack posts vertically (statues) or embed horizontally

## 🖼️ Media Posting Rules

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| 📸 Image | Posted as icon preview — click to view full |
| 📹 Video | Same as image, opens in viewer pop-out |
| 📝 Text Note | Puffy-painted sticky note style |
| 🎭 Emoji/Icons | Used as interaction entry points (e.g., click camera to view pic) |

- All uploads stored privately unless posted on Wallpaper
- Toggle phase enables advanced actions (reposting, NFTs, trails)

## 🔁 Exploreability Boost

- Post icons do **not disrupt design** — they serve as **interactive portals**  
- Viewers must **click** emoji symbols or art nodes to open content  
- Keeps map immersive, uncluttered, and beautifully abstract

---

## 🎨 Canvas Features

- Graffiti Mode  
- Collage Doodle Stickers  
- Thought Clouds float above wallpaper until pinned  
- Pinned = becomes part of grid, viewable to others

## 👁 Lore Echo

> “This wall is not static. It’s breathing.”
