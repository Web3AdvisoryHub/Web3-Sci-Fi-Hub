## 📜 Overview

This system allows viral or emotionally powerful post statues to be **archived as permanent artifacts**.  
They can be **nominated**, **curated**, and **visited** in the future Codex Shrine Museum (VR-capable).

---

## 🗿 Statue Criteria

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 10+ reposts | Must be organically shared across dorms |
| Emotional Signature | Unique tag combo (e.g. joy + regret) |
| Time Survived | Exists on Wallpaper for 10+ days without damage |
| No Troll Reports | Remains unlooted and untouched |

---

## 🧱 Statue Mechanics

- Posts stacked into vertical shrines
- Can be built by one or multiple users
- Emotional resonance affects glow, aura, or background music
- Builders can name their shrine and add a final message or motto

---

## 🧩 Museum Integration

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Shrine Teleport | Zoom-in from constellation overlay |
| Visitor Entry Fee | Small fee split with Builder & Codex treasury |
| Echo Tour Mode | Narrates top shrines in poetic form |
| Donation Box | Visitors can tip Builder or leave sticker comment |

---

## 🧠 Builder Incentives

- Museum shrine = badge + mintable scroll
- Popular shrines may gain **Lore Echoes** in future Codex books
- Museum placement increases Builder profile value
