## 🎁 What Are Sticker Scroll Packs?

Scroll Packs are **loot-style collectible crates** crafted by Builders.  
They allow users to buy, unlock, or discover **themed sticker sets** — often tied to realms, quests, or emotional bundles.

## 🎨 Scroll Pack Design

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Theme | Sticker packs follow a vibe: e.g. “Lovesick,” “Tech Wounds,” “Meme Gods” |
| Rarity | Stickers are ranked: Common, Rare, Echoic, Glyphbound |
| Visual | Packs animate with pixel or scroll-style effects |
| Emotion Tags | Each sticker comes with emotion-based interaction |

## 🔓 Opening Packs

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Buy a scroll pack | Costs $GEN or unlocks via quest |
| Open it | Animation plays → sticker cards are revealed |
| Pick | Some packs allow you to choose, others are random |
| Fuse | Combine stickers to make enhanced tattoos or scroll spells |

2. Uploads sticker art or chooses from Codex pool
3. Defines emotion tags, effects, and rarity
4. Sets sale type: public, realm-only, or limited
5. Users open → Builder earns % of sales + reactions
