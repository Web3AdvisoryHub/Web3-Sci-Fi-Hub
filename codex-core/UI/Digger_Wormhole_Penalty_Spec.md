# 🕳️ Digger Wormhole Penalty System  
*“The Source Sees You.”*

---

## ✨ What Is This?

A **troll deterrent system** built into the Wallpaper Feed —  
designed to make post digging risky, hilarious, and narratively satisfying.

---

## 🧨 The Digger Risk Loop

| Action | Risk |
|--------|------|
| Dig up shrine posts repeatedly | Each dig adds a *Source Strike* to your soulchain |
| At 7 digs | Echo warns: “The Source sees you…” |
| At 9 digs | Final warning: “One more breach... and you begin again.” |
| At 10 strikes | Wormhole event triggers — **you’re deleted and reborn** |

---

## 🌀 Wormhole Strike Consequences

| Event | Result |
|-------|--------|
| 💀 Avatar Pulled | You are sucked into a glowing void — avatar erased |
| 🧼 Account Reset | Dorm gone, soulchain cleared, Builder status revoked |
| 💸 Loot Vomit | All scrolls, items, and stickers explode out of the wormhole as airdrops |
| 🌱 Respawn | You begin again — fresh soulchain, new dorm, all memory lost (but Source remembers) |

## 🎯 Catching a Digger

Builders can:
- Report diggers when their post is looted
- Observe suspicious shrine activity
- Bait trolls with honey traps (booby-trapped shrines)
- Earn bonuses for catching them (see “Holy Builder”)

## ✨ Optional Bonuses

|--------|-------------|
| “Holy Builder” Aura | Successfully trap & report 3 diggers |
| Digger’s Shame Sticker | Limited edition LOL collectible for those who got sucked |
| Echo Log Bonus | Unlock rare Echo message for surviving 10 digs without reset
