## ✨ What Are Thought Clouds?

**Thought Clouds** are private or semi-private “idea nodes” that live inside a user's room or dorm wall.  
They represent unposted feelings, draft scrolls, or creative fragments — organized like floating sticky notes or bubble clusters.

---

## ☁️ Cloud Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Private Thought | Only you see it — perfect for journaling or memory keeping |
| Pinned Idea | Visible in your room — future scroll, storefront, or realm seed |
| Builder Bubble | Tagged for development — may glow if updated or evolved |
| Memory Mist | Time-sensitive or emotional clouds that fade unless reposted |

---

## 🧠 Core Interactions

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Create Thought Cloud | Opens a floating sticky you can type or draw in |
| Pin to Wall | Becomes a public-facing part of your builder brain |
| Archive | Sends cloud to your scroll library or unlock log |
| Merge | Combine clouds to evolve them into scrolls or blueprints |
