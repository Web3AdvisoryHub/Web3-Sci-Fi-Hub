> “The wall was never just a wall. It was always the sky, inverted.”

---

## ✨ Overview

This system transforms the Wallpaper feed into a **zoomed-out starmap**, where posts become **stars**, reposts become **clusters**, and viral statues form **constellations**.

---

## 🔭 Feed → Cosmos Conversion

| Action | Cosmic Equivalent |
|--------|-------------------|
| Post on wall | Becomes a single star |
| Repost thread | Creates star trail |
| Viral Statue | Forms a glowing constellation cluster |
| Emotional tag match | Adds nebula shimmer or aurora |
| Loot rain event | Appears as meteor shower |

---

## 📍 Navigation Logic

- Users scroll through the wall normally  
- When they zoom out past threshold, UI fades into a **night-sky style view**
- Posts now appear as light points, grouped by recency, emotion, or creator
- Clicking a star zooms back into that post

---

## 💠 Visual Filters

| Mode | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Timeline | Stars dim by age |
| Emotion | Stars colored by tag (joy = yellow, grief = blue, etc.) |
| Creator | Stars grouped by dorm |
| Glowstorm | Highlights “rising” posts (like viral shimmer) |

---

## 🪐 Galaxy Layering

- Statues that form special patterns may **evolve into Codex constellations**
- May unlock lore triggers or hidden scrolls if aligned properly
- Codex maps may mirror ancient starmaps hidden in Book Two

---

## 🧠 Lore Echo

> “We post to remember. We zoom out to understand.  
> And then we realize — the cosmos is built from our clutter.”
