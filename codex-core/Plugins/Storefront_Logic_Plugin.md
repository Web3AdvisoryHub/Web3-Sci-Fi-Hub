## 🏪 What Is a Storefront?

A **Storefront** is a customizable Builder-owned shop in Codex Town.  
Each shop acts as a fusion of:
- Digital wallet
- Visual marketplace
- Lore-linked brand identity
- Creator-owned revenue space

## 🧩 Store Types

| Type | Function |
|------|----------|
| Scroll Shop | Sell NFT scrolls, quests, lore bundles |
| Trait Boutique | Offer avatar skins, Dorm add-ons |
| Artifact Emporium | Tools, Toggle NFTs, Builder utilities |
| Real World Mirror | Link to real physical items (books, art, merch) |
| Service Den | Offer mentoring, coding reviews, or classes |

---

## 💰 Economic Flow

- Storefronts can mint their own “branded” token variant of $GEN
- Builders set prices in $GEN or scroll trades
- Optional: Offer discount tokens or loyalty rewards
- Codex receives royalty split from all transactions
