## üîå What Are Codex Plugins?

Plugins are **modular features** that extend the Codex world without breaking its core logic.  
They can be:
- Entirely cosmetic (meme coin wall art)
- Interactive (shopfronts, airdrop clubs)
- Structural (event zones, realm teleporters)

---

## üß± Plugin Examples

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Meme_Coin_Park | Meme charting system disguised as theme park |
| Storefront_Logic | Lets Builders sell scrolls, overlays, or realm access |
| Echo Logs | Echo audio memory scrolls from Builders |
| Airdrop Club | VR event stage for coin or scroll giveaways |
| Builder Shop Shell | Template for mintable, upgradable storefronts |

## üß† Dev Plugin Tips

- Plugins should follow Codex tone (symbolic, poetic, utility-based)
- Ideal files:
  - `Plugin_Name.md` for logic description
  - Optional `.json` config files
- Can trigger Echo voice lines, scrolls, or gated quests

## üõí Example Flow: Builder Storefront

1. Builder mints a scroll with shop metadata  
2. Plugin reads wallet trait ‚Üí activates visual in dorm  
3. Guest enters ‚Üí sees listing + must hold correct scroll to buy
