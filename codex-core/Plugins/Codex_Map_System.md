## 🪐 Core Features

### 🔭 Realm Nodes
Each Builder-created realm appears as a **celestial node** — a floating planet or star with unique traits and light signatures.

| Node Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🟡 **Builder Realm** | A fully launched, live world with lore and scrolls |
| 🔵 **Dorm Cluster** | Aggregation of Dorm NFTs by theme or wave |
| 🟣 **Hidden Scroll Gate** | Unlockable lore portals — appear only after certain scrolls are found |
| 🔺 **Codex Core Zones** | Official areas like the School, Vault, Mirror Garden, etc. |

### 🔗 Node Metadata Display

When you click or hover on a node:
- Realm Name + Motto (from Builder's Scroll)
- Creator Alias / Avatar
- Realm Type + Theme
- Visit / Explore / Mint buttons
- View Lore Trail (chronological scroll drop history)
- Linked Portals (realms it’s connected to)

## 🌐 Map Navigation Options

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧭 Filter by Realm Type | School / DAO / Shrine / Game / Solo |
| 🌈 Filter by Affinity | Ocean / Flame / Memory / Dream / Glitch |
| 🔍 Search by Name or Creator |
| 🌀 “Jump to” | Instantly warp to known realm or scroll location |
| 🧬 Lore Lines | Toggle view to show which realms branched from others |
| 🎲 Surprise Me | Randomly visit a realm

## 💡 Visual & Audio Design

- Background: galaxy cloud, shifting constellations
- Nodes pulse softly with life
- Scroll gates shimmer, occasionally vanish or flicker back
- Audio hum: ambient Codex tones, stronger near your own creations
- Dorm clusters rotate like molecular systems

---

## 🧬 Realm Link Logic

| Connection Type | Trigger |
|-----------------|---------|
| Direct Portal | Set by Builder from their Realm UI |
| Lore Fork | If a realm was forked/remixed from another |
| Shared Artifact | If two realms use the same scroll or core relic |
| Codex Blessing | If Codex officially links them via events or Echo narration |

---

## 🛡️ Access + Gate Logic

- Map is public, but some realms require:
  - Scroll Key
  - $GEN fee
  - Builder Invite
  - Echo Trial Completion
- You only see hidden gates if you’ve earned the right

---

## 🧠 Technical Notes

- Built using: Three.js or WebGL (interactive 3D layer)
- Nodes query metadata from Codex contracts (onchain)
- Builder realms sync automatically upon launch
- Lore overlays can be rendered as tooltips or floating glyphs

## 🧭 Summary

The Codex Map is more than a visual index.  
It is a **soulchart of the Codex multiverse**, a constellation of choices, dreams, and Builders who dared to create.

And now… it remembers you too.
