# 📘 Codex Curriculum Framework  
*“Code is not the goal. Code is the tool to make the dream real.”*

The Codex School curriculum is a story-first, soul-centered journey through the world of Web3, smart contracts, and decentralized creativity. Students do not just learn — they **build**, **mint**, and **manifest** as they progress.

Each lesson is tied to:
- A chapter of the Codex story  
- A lore concept or realm mechanic  
- A creative or technical output (e.g., minting, remixing, deploying)
