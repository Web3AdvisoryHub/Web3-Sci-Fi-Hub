## 📚 What Is Codex School?

Codex School is the **interactive learning arc** that begins after Book One and evolves through the Codex Campus.

Here, players:
- Receive scrolls and quests as lessons
- Customize their avatar
- Learn coding, realm logic, and builder tools
- Progress from student → builder → realm creator

Every course is wrapped in lore. Every test is a quest.

| Dorm Studies | Personal room-based unlocks |
| Quest Zones | Puzzle-based learning trails |

## 🧠 Dev + Builder Tips

- Design classes around:
  - Scrolls instead of textbooks
  - Echo logs instead of lectures
  - Action steps instead of quizzes
- Builders can eventually:
  - Host their own classrooms
  - Grant guest access to students
  - Issue scrolls that unlock new subjects
