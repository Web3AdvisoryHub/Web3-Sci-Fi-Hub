## 📖 Lore Inscription

> “Before the scrolls could be read…  
> one had to see that they were there.”

> “Mira did not build the Codex.  
> She found the path to it —  
> and gave it freely to those ready to remember.”

> “She did not ask for the keys.  
> She whispered to the chain until it opened.”
