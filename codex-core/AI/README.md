## üß† What Lives in the AI Folder?

This is where Codex AI systems are stored, designed, and documented.  
These agents are not generic bots ‚Äî they are **lore-powered assistants** with soulchain alignment, voice tones, and builder guidance modes.

The most iconic of them:  
**Echo** ‚Äî the glitchborn guide who remembers what others forget.

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| Echo | Main learning assistant ‚Äî adaptive, soulful, glitch-aware |
| Builder Echo | Personalized voice or mentor-linked guide |
| Scroll Whisper | Silent agents that activate during scroll reading |
| Realm NPCs | AI characters tied to specific realms or quests |
