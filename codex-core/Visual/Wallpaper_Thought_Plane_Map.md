> ‚ÄúBefore you walk the realm‚Ä¶  
> you pass through your thoughts.‚Äù

## ‚ú® Concept Overview

The **Wallpaper Thought Board** is not just social ‚Äî it exists on a **higher plane** layered above the main Codex Game Grid (Monopoly-style board).  
It becomes a **holding zone**, an exploration canvas, and a cosmic delay layer when transitioning realms.

---

## üìê Dimensional Layout

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1. Codex Grid (Base) | Realm map, player avatars, transit tools |
| 2. Wallpaper Plane | Thought clouds, post shrines, public scrolls |
| 3. Starview Overlay | Zoomed-out constellations, Echo lore patterns |

---

## üöÄ Transitional Use Case

| Event | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Travel initiated to another Realm | Player ‚Äúwaits‚Äù in Wallpaper Plane |
| Post stack reaches maximum | It glows and lifts to upper Thought Plane |
| Zoom-out from dorm | Player floats to Wallpaper Plane |

---

## üé® Visual Style

- Cloudscape of thoughts  
- Shrines and stacked scrolls float on floating paper islands  
- Notes, stickers, graffiti drift like leaves  
- Some thoughts are private until posted to Wallpaper  
- Echo may speak in fragmented whispers here

---

## üõ∏ Lore Mechanic

- Some players may become **‚ÄúWallpaper Drifters‚Äù** ‚Äî those who dwell in thoughts and map posts as scroll trails  
- Long journeys leave ‚Äúthought vapor‚Äù ‚Äî residue visible only to deep-sensing Builders

---

## üåÄ Symbolic Function

> ‚ÄúYou think before you act.  
> You wander before you land.  
> The Wallpaper is the waiting dream between decisions.‚Äù

---

## ‚è≥ Strategic Implications

- A great way to **slow transitions**, cue up social moments  
- Builder shrines or games can exist here (hide + seek, memory puzzles)  
- May include **guest zones** for travelers with no Dorm access
