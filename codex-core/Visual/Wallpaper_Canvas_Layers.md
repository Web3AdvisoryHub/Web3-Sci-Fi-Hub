## 🧱 Layered Canvas Overview

The Codex Wallpaper is a **multi-dimensional canvas** that merges memory, creativity, and social gameplay into a rich visual map.

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| 1. Canvas Base | Ground level — walking, driving, posting, digging |
| 2. Thought Clouds | Floating ideas, stickered balloons, memory trails |
| 3. Shrines & Stacks | 3D post statues, shrine quests, builder archives |
| 4. Graffiti Layer | Player-authored whiteboards, doodles, stickers |
| 5. Loot Layer | Air-dropped loot, trash, and clean-up trails |
| 6. Constellation Overlay | Zoom-out view — maps memory to the Codex stars |

## ✨ Post Interaction Zones

| Zone Type | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| Shrine Base | Stack posts into physical shrines |
| Graffiti Zone | Open canvas for drawing/sticker tagging |
| Trash Fields | Uncleaned areas—create janitor earnings |
| AirDrop Fields | Loot lands here when trolls are purged |
| Portal Zones | High-post areas can activate realm portals |

## 🎨 Visual Styles

- Posts appear as layered **papercraft tiles**  
- Shrines glow faintly and echo player moods  
- Thought clouds drift with emotional tags  
- Loot sparkles or flickers depending on type
- Footprints, dirt, and drag marks appear over time if uncleaned

---

## 🛠 Builder Customization

Builders can:
- Choose default canvas mood (day, dusk, neon, dream)
- Add parallax sticker backgrounds
- Create **zones that react** to emotion tags (e.g., sad zones trigger rain)

---

## 🧩 Future Extensions

- Animated sticker packs (e.g., wind, birds, waves)
- Emotional weather overlays
- Shrines that hum or echo when hovered
