## 🎨 Avatar Visual Prompt

**Prompt Format for AI-Generated Visuals:**

A stylized [gender/identity] avatar with a soft, fully clay-sculpted body and expressive sculpted clay eyes. The figure has a natural human-like shape, similar to Sims or Pixar characters, designed for both children and adults. The hair is styled [describe style], made entirely of sculpted clay, with optional pixel-art inspired accessories (e.g., stars, stickers, glyphs). The outfit is crafted from colorful clay textures — customizable with pixel, glitter, or puffer-paint patterns.

The background reflects the avatar’s realm (e.g., cosmic nebula, dreamy campus, ancient scroll library, cyber forest). The design evokes a friendly, imaginative, whimsical tone — ideal for immersive, narrative-driven game environments. Facial expressions and features should be approachable, inclusive, and stylized.

Do not use realism. Maintain a consistent handcrafted claymation style.
