## 🌌 Overview

The Codex experience unfolds across **three major visual planes** — from symbolic UI icons to immersive avatar-led spaces. Each layer serves a different depth of interaction and immersion.

---

## 🧱 Layer 1: Flat UI (Scroll Grid + Thought Canvas)

- **Visual Style:** Paper-like, colorful, glittery, sticker-padded canvas
- **Functionality:** Thought posting, sticky notes, emojis, archived scroll trails
- **Movement:** Users walk/hike/drive around the canvas (zoomable)
- **Mood:** Creative, playful, diary-like
- **Feature:** Doodle mode, post stacking, graffiti board

---

## 🧍 Layer 2: Avatar Room (Dorm View)

- **Visual Style:** Claymation-inspired, full-body 3D Sims-style avatars
- **Functionality:** Avatar customization, NFT toggle rooms, sticker-to-body traits
- **Mood:** Cozy, expressive, visually rich and fun
- **Feature:** Thought clouds form above the avatar's head, reactable wall board

---

## 🪐 Layer 3: World Map View (Codex Campus, Realms, Sky)

- **Visual Style:** Isometric pixel + lush vector maps
- **Functionality:** Travel to Realms, explore towns, enter museums, visit campuses
- **Mood:** Mystical, exploratory, colorful
- **Feature:** Realms appear as stars or islands; users move between layers

---

## 🧠 Zoom & Fusion Logic

- Scroll out = Map view  
- Scroll in = Canvas board  
- Tap avatar = enter Dorm room  
- Follow a realm = enter world interface view

---

## 🧙 Lore Layering

Each layer carries **symbolic and narrative weight**:

| Layer | Lore Purpose |
|-------|--------------|
| Canvas | Echo of memory, creativity, dreams |
| Dorm | Present self, intention, expression |
| Map | Future potential, choice, constellation calling |

---

## 🧬 Integration Plan

- Stickers operate across **all 3 layers**
- Loot from scrolls appears first on canvas → then becomes traits
- Post statues rise through layers when emotionally resonant

> “Zoom in to remember. Zoom out to see your place in the story.”
