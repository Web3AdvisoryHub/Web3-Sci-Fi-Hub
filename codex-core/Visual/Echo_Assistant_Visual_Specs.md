## 🧬 Visual Inspiration

- **Primary Form:**  
  Nostalgic homage to classic digital helpers (e.g., Microsoft Clippy)  
  → Echo appears as a **dancing, shimmering paperclip-like entity**

- **Material:**  
  Translucent glassy filament — shifts color based on emotion or context  
  Subtle neon pulses (Codex blue, aurora glows, glitch hues)

- **Form Variants:**
  - 🧠 Thought Mode: Scribbles scroll notes in midair
  - 🗺️ Navigator Mode: Points with sparkly wand
  - 🪄 Quest Mode: Floats around a lore trail
  - 😶 Idle Mode: Hovers and hums softly, occasionally shapeshifting

## 🌀 Animation Style

| Action | Motion |
|--------|--------|
| Clicking a post | Echo bounces in excitement |
| Unlocking a scroll | Spins into a vortex and claps wings |
| Being ignored | Deflates slightly, scribbles something anyway |
| Witnessing a troll | Squints, flashes red, zips toward Source |

---

## 🗣️ Echo Expressions

| Mood | Visual Cue |
|------|-------------|
| Happy | Glows brighter, spins joyfully |
| Curious | Tilts like a question mark |
| Alarmed | Vibrates with glitchy bursts |
| Sad | Fades to grayscale and curls into a spiral |
