## 🌠 What Is the Codex Visual Layer?

The `Visual/` folder defines the **aesthetic logic** of the Codex universe — how rooms, scrolls, avatars, and realms are **seen, styled, and symbolized.**

It includes:
- Room layout blueprints
- Avatar design guides
- Constellation logic and spatial overlays
- Notes for BasePaint and other plugins

---

## 🧭 Key Visual Elements

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Dorm Layouts | Define scroll slots, toggle areas, storefront hooks |
| Star Charts | Visual logic of realm nodes and Builder constellations |
| Room Themes | Variants like Ocean, Glitch, Flame, Dream |
| UI Sketches | Moodboard-style notes for Web2-friendly flows |

---

## 📁 Files You’ll Find Here

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Room_Visual_Layout_Blueprint.md` | Interactive dorm design structure |
| `Avatar_Style_Guide.md` (optional) | Sims-meets-pixel aesthetic notes |
| `Constellation_Overlay_Sketch.md` (optional) | How star nodes align with realms |

## 🧠 Builder Tips

- Visual files can evolve over time
- Use this as your **blueprint sketch zone** for room evolution
- Room skins may respond to:
  - Affinity (Flame = red tones, Ocean = ripple)
  - Scroll type
  - Builder's motto or quest path

## 🌌 Lore Echo

> “The Codex is not decorated. It is remembered through design.”

> “Every corner, curve, and color… was once imagined by a Builder like you.”
