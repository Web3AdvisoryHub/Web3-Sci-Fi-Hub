**Codex Wiki Entry: Scroll-core Aesthetic**

**Type:** Cultural Aesthetic / Digital Fashion Movement  
**Status:** Emerging  
**Codex Tier:** Layer 1 (Unlocked after Chloe's early visual syncs)

---

**Definition:**
Scroll-core is a digital fashion + vibe aesthetic born out of endless feed scrolling, glitch glam, and curated-but-effortless style. It represents the hybrid life of soft tech users — stylish, emotionally complex, and always a little mysterious.

---

**Visual Identity:**
- Glitchy textures, shimmer seams, pastel overlays
- Wearables that look like swipeable filters or mood rings
- Cyber accessories: QR charm clips, pixel purses, translucent visors
- Outfits designed to ‘pop’ in motion (for story capture or scroll loops)
- NFT-sticker patches as collectibles or mood badges

---

**Vibe Identity:**
- Emotionally self-aware, digitally untouchable
- Feels like: a late-night facetime, a soft echo in your For You Page
- Scroll-core users don’t follow trends—they let the algorithm chase *them*
- Often described as: *"Like you woke up viral but didn’t care."

---

**Known Users:**
- **Chloe:** Accidental scroll-core icon due to her natural aesthetic + glitched suit design
- **Lainey (adjacent):** Scroll-core adjacent, she leverages it for engagement but adds glitter-bomb cheerleader energy
- **Codex Avatars:** Scroll-core becomes a foundational look for avatars in early Codex realms

---

**Sticker Culture Integration:**
Scroll-core includes collectible stickers that reflect personal digital journeys. Examples:
- "Mood Unavailable" holographic heart
- “404 Crush Not Found” banner
- Glitch-flower icons that bloom with completed challenges

---

**Expansion Potential:**
Scroll-core isn’t just fashion. It’s a *language.* Codex players may customize their realms, dormants, and shopfronts using scroll-core templates unlocked via story milestones or smart contract completions.

**Tagline:**
_"You weren’t born to be filtered. You were born to scroll through the layers and glitch beautifully."_
