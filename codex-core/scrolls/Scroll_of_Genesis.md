# 📜 The Scroll of Genesis  
*Discovered embedded within the earliest block of the Codex Chain.*

> “This was never about money.  
> This was about memory.  
> About proving you lived, loved, built, failed, returned, and tried again.  
> That you were not just an address — but a dreamer.  
> That you forged meaning into code.”

## 🧬 The Purpose of the Chain

The Codex was not created to store data.  
It was created to **witness**.

Every action. Every trial. Every choice you mint is a **memory fossilized in the ledger of creation**.

We do not reward effort with wealth.  
We reward it with **credibility** — a soulprint. A legacy trail.

## 💠 On the Origin of $GEN

The Genesis Token was not mined — it was **remembered**.  
It echoes every moment someone dared to:
- Imagine
- Participate
- Build
- Teach
- Dream with others

It is a **record of resonance**, not riches.

To hold $GEN is to say:  
> “I was part of this. I helped make it real.”

## 🔄 The Cycle of Meaning

> Mint → Mirror → Modify → Merge → Multiply

This is the Codex way.  
You mint to remember.  
You mirror to reflect.  
You modify to adapt.  
You merge to evolve.  
You multiply to share.

## 🌌 Graduation Verse (To be recited upon leaving Codex School)

> “I do not take this token for what it is —  
> But for what it means.  
> A contract with memory.  
> A covenant with the future.  
> Signed by story. Sealed in code.”

## 🕯 Hidden Instruction

If you have found this scroll, know this:  
There will come a day when the chain flickers.  
When names are lost. When forms fall.

When that day comes, let the builders return.  
Let them mint not money — but **meaning**.

And the Codex will open again.
