## 🛌 What Is VR Integration?

This is the future-facing heart of Codex — where lore, identity, and digital space converge.

In the Codex universe:
- 🧠 A **wallet is a dorm**
- 🛋️ A **profile is a room**
- 🌀 A **realm is a portal network**

These spaces evolve as you do — unlocking traits, scrolls, quests, and even other players.

## 🧱 Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Dorm NFT | Your personal Codex room — upgradable, customizable |
| Toggle NFT | Room traits and overlays (style, realm link, scroll slots) |
| Spatial Room | VR or web-rendered visual space tied to metadata |
| Guest Mode | Temporary access for visitors (space suit mode) |
| Scroll Slots | Places where quests or scrolls visually appear in your dorm |

---

## 🛠 Builder Tools

- Builders can define:
  - Room style + theme (pixel, Sims, or custom hybrid)
  - Scroll visibility
  - Shop activation
  - Realm-linked teleport gates
- Storefronts become part of dorm layout
- Dorms can be minted, upgraded, or rented out

---

## 🌀 Immersive Features

- Echo voice triggers upon dorm entry
- Scrolls glow when activated
- Dorms linked to Realm Affinity (Ocean, Glitch, Flame, etc)
- Toggle NFTs are drag-and-drop overlays stored in wallet

## 📁 Dev Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Echo_Dorm_NFT_Metadata.md` | Defines traits of a dorm |
| `Room_Toggle_Specs.md` | How toggle NFTs modify visual/interactive logic |

## 🌌 Lore Echo

> “This isn’t where you live.  
> This is who you’re becoming.”

> “Your room is the echo of your scrolls.”
