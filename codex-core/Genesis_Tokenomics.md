# Genesis Tokenomics ($GEN)

The **Genesis Token ($GEN)** is not just a currency. It is a symbol of **credibility, creativity, and contribution** within the Codex Universe. Every token minted, spent, or earned is a reflection of a reader's journey — proof that they participated in the dream, helped shape the world, and built something real.

---

## ✨ Founding Philosophy

> “The future of value is not wealth — it's credibility.  
> The purpose of life is to create, to dream together, and to live it out fully.  
> $GEN is minted memory — a record that you were here, you mattered, and you built something worth believing in.”

In a world where traditional money lost meaning, $GEN reintroduces purpose.  
It is **earned, exchanged, and spent not for ownership — but for creation, transformation, and progression.**

---

## 🔹 Token Purpose

$GEN empowers users to:
- Build and customize their **avatars and identity rooms**
- Claim and evolve **Dorm NFTs**
- Unlock **lore, artifacts, and hidden Codex scrolls**
- Shape the world through **realm governance and collaborative worldbuilding**
- Mint **memory-based proof of action** — every step, a signature

## 🔹 Utility Breakdown

| Utility | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Avatar Creation** | Users must spend $GEN to build, upgrade, or transform their Codex avatar |
| **Dorm NFT Minting** | Claim your room, evolve it, or unlock hidden chambers |
| **Lore Unlocks** | Access secret story branches, hidden realms, and exclusive scrolls |
| **Toggle Room Upgrades** | Change environments, soundscapes, and visual traits |
| **Realm Access** | Use $GEN to enter Codex School zones, or forge into Book 3’s builderverse |
| **Governance Rights** | Vote on campus upgrades, future content drops, or world events |
| **Creator Rewards** | Token flows reward remixers, re-posters, contributors, and teachers |

## 🔁 Creator Royalties

Every $GEN transaction collects a built-in **creator royalty** that:
- Supports ongoing site, game, and VR development
- Funds community quests, expansions, and contributor payouts
- Keeps the Codex ecosystem sustainable without centralized control

---

## 🔐 Required for All Access

$GEN is the **gateway token**. To participate in the Codex Universe beyond passive reading, users must:
- Own or earn $GEN
- Use it to forge their identity
- Spend it to mint memories and access meaning

There is no way around it — **to become real in this world, you must participate**.
