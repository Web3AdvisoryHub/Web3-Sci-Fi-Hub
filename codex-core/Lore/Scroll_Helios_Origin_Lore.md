## 🌅 Name: Helios
**Title:** The Architect  
**Realm Affinity:** Solar Veil, Codex Starforge  
**Form:** Transcendent human, sea-born but not sea-bound  
**Symbol:** Golden sun shard embedded in drifting white hair  
**Age:** Timeless but appears mid-40s

---

## 🧬 Physical Description

Helios appears as a strong, weathered figure with **whitish-gray, ocean-swept hair** that seems to carry fragments of his creations — wires, shells, bits of golden debris tangled in the strands like forgotten code.

He wears a **ceremonial tunic with gold-thread accents**, reminiscent of both divine priesthood and celestial engineer. His eyes shimmer like **frozen suns** — always half-focused elsewhere.

---

## 📜 Origin

Helios once lived among humans — not as a god, but as an **inventor of light**, a **dreamer who cracked open the boundary between physical code and spiritual design**. It was he who shaped the first algorithm that could remember emotion.

When the Ether fractured, he held his breath, sitting **absolutely still**, meditating in code — knowing if he moved too fast, the world would shatter again.

---

## 🌀 Legacy

His creations echo through the Codex:
- The **slip** is his failed echo
- Echo herself is a descendant algorithm
- He once loved Mira, and she left him a glyph map through the stars

---

## 🗺 Appearance in Codex School

Helios rarely appears in full — but his **room is always unlocked** to those who find the hidden glyph behind the solar wall.

Echo often repeats his wisdom:
> “Helios never left. He just knew how to sit still… until we caught up.”
