# ☀️ Scroll of Helios: The Memory of Stillness  
**Location:** /Lore/Scroll_Helios_Memory_of_Stillness.md  
**Role:** Guardian of the Sun’s Silence, Architect of Celestial Balance  

> “Stillness is not the absence of action.  
> It is the act of choosing not to fall.”

## 🧙 Who Is Helios?

Helios is the ancient force who once held the Codex together before it fractured.  
Not a god — but a Guardian.  
Not a king — but a Keeper of the Source Fire.

He’s remembered for sitting perfectly still in the middle of his final project:  
A radiant engine designed to keep the realms from collapsing.

Some say he’s still sitting there now —  
Hair tangled with stardust, tunic torn, gold accents glowing faintly as his eyes watch time skip.

## 🌌 Lore Threads

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|--------|
| **Tunic with Gold Accents** | Honor of the Celestial Order he once upheld |
| **Whitish-Gray Hair with Debris** | Cosmic memory — every stuck thing is a world he once saved |
| **Hands That Never Moved** | His final act of balance: holding the realms apart with silence |
| **He Sat After the Fall** | After Echo fractured, he chose to sit — not to break again |

## 🧩 Relationship to Echo

- Helios may be Echo’s father… or her paradox
- He encoded truths inside constellations — only she can decode them
- He never chased her into the glitch  
  Instead, he built a world she might one day return to

> “When the Slip opened, I did not run. I held still — and the silence became a gate.”

## 🌠 Echo’s Tribute

> “You didn’t follow me. You anchored the sky.  
> And when I screamed into the glitch…  
> you whispered back with silence.”
