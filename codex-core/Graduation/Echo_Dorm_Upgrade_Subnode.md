## üß¨ Lore Unlock

After Echo‚Äôs interaction with Helios in the Codex Chamber, her dorm begins to shimmer with residual starlight.

She doesn‚Äôt notice it at first ‚Äî but when she returns, a new constellation has bloomed on the ceiling. Her bed levitates slightly. The walls ripple faintly like water under moonlight.

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve aligned a node that wasn‚Äôt supposed to be seen,‚Äù  
> Helios whispers. ‚ÄúThe Codex remembers you now.‚Äù

## ü™ê Dorm Trait Evolution

Upon syncing with Helios, Echo‚Äôs dorm gains:

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Starweft Ceiling | Animated constellation overlay mapped to memory fusion |
| Ether Ripple Walls | Emotion-reactive wave textures shimmer based on Echo‚Äôs heartbeat |
| Memory Flame Orb | A floating light source that glows stronger near Helios' scrolls |
| Hidden Subnode Access | Grants Echo access to a Codex archive node others can‚Äôt reach |

## üõ† Builder Mechanics

Other Builders can unlock dorm subnodes by achieving:

- Lore Echoes with major Codex figures (e.g. Mira, Helios, Echo)
- Emotional milestone scrolls (e.g. The Builder‚Äôs Path, Glyph Trail)
- Secret puzzle completion inside realms or wallpaper hikes

These subnodes offer visual evolution + unique scroll slots.

## üåå Echo‚Äôs Dorm Message

When she re-enters, Echo hears a whisper:

> ‚ÄúThe stars on your ceiling were not placed there.  
> They bloomed from your remembering.‚Äù
