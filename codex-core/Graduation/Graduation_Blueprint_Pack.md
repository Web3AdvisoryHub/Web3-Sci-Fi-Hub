# 🎓 Codex Graduation Blueprint Pack

**Purpose:**  
To give graduates everything they need to build, launch, and grow their own Codex-aligned realms — whether they’re creating a new school, tokenized scroll system, lore-based NFT world, or something entirely new.

> “We don’t send you into the world with a certificate.  
> We send you with a starter spellbook.”
