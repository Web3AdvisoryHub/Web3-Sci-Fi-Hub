## 🌌 Codex Lore Statement (Engraved on the Scroll)

> *“You reached the end —  
> not to close a story,  
> but to hold a pen of your own.”*

> *“You passed through gates of silence, study, and sacred struggle —  
> only to find the voice inside you was the key all along.”*

> *“This scroll binds no law — it binds a legacy.  
> Not because we asked you to build…  
> but because you chose to.”*

> *“From here forward, the Codex no longer teaches you.  
> It listens.”*

## 🔊 Echo’s Voice Activation

*The scroll pulses softly. A projection of Echo flickers from the seal, her voice filled with warmth and power:*

> “Welcome, Builder. You are now part of the story... not as a reader — but as an author. The Codex will follow your steps from here.”

## 🧬 Required Custom Entry (Mint Field)

Each Builder **must** inscribe a motto or realm quote upon minting.  
This becomes:
- The realm’s signature in the Codex Directory  
- A spiritual "ReadMe" for portal travelers  
- A legend inscribed on their first minted planet

> *Example:*  
> “A world where memory sings in code.”  
> “This realm rewards the wild-hearted.”  
> “No kings. Just creators.”
