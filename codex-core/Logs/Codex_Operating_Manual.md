Welcome to the **Codex Core** — the living, modular system powering the **Web3 Sci-Fi book universe** and the **Codex School** of immersive, realm-based learning.

Every folder in this repo represents a **lore-powered mechanic**: scrolls, quests, dorms, realms, echo trails, and evolving Builder-owned tools.

## ✨ What Is the Codex?

The Codex is more than a story.  
It’s a protocol for unlocking new dimensions of creation, learning, and identity — powered by the soulchain.

🧬 It’s **education wrapped in myth**,  
🧠 **productivity disguised as play**,  
🌌 and **a world where imagination writes code.**
