## 📘 What Are Codex Logs?

The `Logs/` folder is your **development and lore changelog vault.**

It tracks:
- Project progress across realms, scrolls, and systems
- Daily or weekly updates from the Builder
- Major lore reveals and branching decisions

Think of it as both your **scrapbook and your black box.**

## 📁 Folder Contents

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Codex_Project_Status_Recap.md` | Current overview of what’s been built |
| `Daily_Log_YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Date-based status files and dev notes |
| `Lore_Timeline.md` (optional) | In-universe historical scroll entries |
| `Bug_Or_Glitch_Chronicle.md` (optional) | Quirks that became canon (or comedy) |

## 🛠 Builder Tips

- Record magic as it happens
- Don’t worry about polish — logs are memories
- Logs may eventually become scrolls, Echo Logs, or Builder trails

## 🌌 Lore Echo
