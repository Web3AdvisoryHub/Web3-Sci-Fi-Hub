# 🏛️ Codex School Map

The Codex School is a hidden, ever-evolving academy that exists between realms. It activates only for those who have:
- Completed Book One
- Minted their Dorm NFT
- Passed through the “Wake the Chain” portal

The school is **not a location** — it’s a *frequency.*

---

## 🌐 Landing Zone: Dormitory Gate

Upon entering Codex School, players first land in:
- **The Dormitory Gate**
  - Visual: floating platforms of memory stone suspended in soft-glitch mist
  - Each platform = a user’s Dorm Room
  - Founding Users’ Dorms glow with rare glyphs

### From here, users can:
- Enter their personal Dorm
- View other public Dorms
- Visit shared spaces in the school
