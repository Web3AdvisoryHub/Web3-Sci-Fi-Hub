## üé® Map Style

- **Isometric Pixel Art**  
  Cozy and intuitive, with detailed tile-based scenes for each zone.

## üå† Design Mood

- **Mystic Academy + Floating Islands + Soft Cyberpunk Glow**  
  A mythic school hovering in the scrollstream ‚Äî radiant glyphs, cozy paths, and lore-charged portals.

## üß≠ Campus Zones

| Zone | Description |
|------|-------------|
| üõè Dorm Hall | Player dorms (toggleable NFTs), avatar setup, Echo shrine |

| üåÄ Quest Alley | Puzzles, glyph trails, and map fragment fusion activities |
| üåà Airdrop Stage | Coin/sticker drop zone styled like a mini concert or event |
| üß™ Builder Labs | Scroll crafting, NFT customization, testnet experiments |
| üå† Mentor Circle | Realm echoes, affiliate portals, and Builder voice logs |
| üö™ Realm Gates | Portal doors to Builder-created realms (Book 3+ access) |
| üõç Meme Market Row | Shops and plugin-powered zones (meme art = wall skins) |

---

## üåå Visual Layers

- Floating scroll paths between zones
- Hover-glow when zones are unlocked
- Echo appears when you pause in any major area

- Optional: toggle between ‚ÄúQuiet Mode‚Äù or ‚ÄúEcho Companion Mode‚Äù

---

## üîÑ Future Layering Ideas

- Event zones that only appear when special scrolls are minted
- Seasonal visual updates via Builder votes

---

## ‚ú® Campus Vibe

> ‚ÄúEvery zone is a scroll.  
> And every scroll is a door.‚Äù
