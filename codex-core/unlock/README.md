## üìñ What Is the Unlock Folder?

The `unlock/` directory is where **book readers activate their journey** into the Codex multiverse.

Upon completing *Genesis Protocol* (Book One), users:
- Visit `/unlock`
- Receive scroll-based access
- Begin minting their dorm
- Set avatar and soulchain imprint
- Trigger the portal to Codex School

| First Scroll Claim | Gives players their first lore NFT |
| Email Collection | Golden Ticket or invite access system |
| Avatar Initiation | Sets up player dorm + soulchain |
| Portal Entry | Unlocks `/campus` and Builder UI layer |

## üìÅ Files You‚Äôll Find Here

| File | Purpose |

## üß† Dev + Builder Notes

- Unlock page should feel **magical, secure, and soulbound**
- Readers should never feel like they‚Äôre ‚Äúsigning up‚Äù ‚Äî they‚Äôre **awakening**
- Use soft animation, echo text, and scroll-based language

## üåå Lore Echo

> ‚ÄúThe scroll didn‚Äôt wait for you.  
> It waited for the version of you that finished the story.‚Äù
