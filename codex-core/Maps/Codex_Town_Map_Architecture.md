**Type:** World Design + Player Hub Logic  
**Purpose:** A visual, interactive gameboard-style town where Dorms, Builders, shops, and meme parks co-exist — turning the Codex into a playable, living world.

> “The Codex is not just a school.  
> It is a town where builders become legends.”

## 🏙️ What Is the Codex Town?

The Codex Town is a **narrative metaverse layer**:
- Maps Dorms into neighborhoods
- Hosts shops, scroll vendors, realm portals, meme parks, & Builder-run businesses
- Becomes the central gameplay hub of Codex post-Dorm mint

## 🎡 Meme Coin Park Logic

| Marketplace Portal | Users can purchase small themed lots or sticker packs |

## 🧑‍💼 Business & Builder Zones

- Shops can issue their own flavor of $GEN as discount tokens
- Builders can sell copies of their shops, Dorm templates, tools
- Builder communities mapped like **Monopoly tiles** (claimable land plots)
- Voting spaces for real-world projects (Education, Health, etc)
- Governance hubs for Realm-level decision-making

---

## 📐 Visual Metaphor

The Codex Town Map blends:
- 🎲 Monopoly (claimable, upgradable tiles)
- 🎠 Sims + Stardew Valley (character interactions, business logic)
- 🌍 Metaverse world layer (scrolls, airdrops, interactive graphs)
- 🔗 Onchain transparency (transactions mapped to land)

## 🧠 Lore Overlay

> “Not all chains are cold.  
> Some are cities — built link by link, by dreamers who remember.”

> “This is not just where you learn.  
> It’s where you build your legend.”

---

## 🔓 Expansion Ideas

- Town skins based on season or Realm influence
- Builders can host quests, airdrops, or festivals
- Public square for project launches + DAO decision votes
- Avatars can toggle between neighborhood and Codex map mode
