## üåå What Are Codex Maps?

Maps in the Codex are **multilayered blueprints** of space, story, and logic.

They are not only visual aids ‚Äî they are:
- üß© Quest containers
- ü™ê Realm markers
- üõ∏ Builder placements
- üß≠ Progression indicators

## üèô Map Types

| Map | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Town Map | Layout of Builder dorms, shops, and themed zones |
| Galaxy Map | Constellation chart of all known realms |
| Node System | Logical placement for quests, echoes, scroll gates |
| Scroll Fusion Map | Shows where fragments must align |

---

## üìÅ Core Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Codex_Galaxy_Node_Map.md` | Global star chart and realm placement system |
| `Codex_Town_Map_Architecture.md` | Builder dorms, meme parks, quest stalls, shopfronts |
| `Map_Fragment_Fusion_Logic.md` | Mechanics behind scroll fusion and map unlocking |

---

## üß† Dev Tips

- Node IDs should follow lore-consistent patterns (e.g., `node_flame_003`)
- Use lore scrolls to unlock visual map pieces
- Players may start with a blank map and reveal zones via scrolls or quests
