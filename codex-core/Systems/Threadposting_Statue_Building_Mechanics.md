## 🗨️ Threadposting Mechanics

- Users create "threads" by linking multiple posts together:
  - Each additional post in a thread strengthens emotional resonance
  - Threads form visible "chains" or "paths" across Wallpaper

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Linking Posts | Creates emotional narrative trails |
| Thread Completion | Boosts visibility, emotional aura, and monetization |
| Popular Threads | Transform into statues, monuments, or constellations |

## 🗿 Statue Building Logic

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Stack multiple posts vertically | Form visual statue |
| Reach emotional resonance threshold | Statue gains aura, glow, music |
| Survive troll attempts | Eligible for Museum archive |
| Public interaction | Adds layers, graffiti, stickers to statue base |

---

## 🎖 Statue Rewards

- Emotional "charged" statues grant bonus traits and scroll auras
- Builders receive $GEN royalties from statue visitors and interactions
- Popular statues may trigger lore events, quests, or museum entry

| Reward | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| Statue Badge | Build first successful statue |
| Statue Guardian | Protect statue from 5+ troll attacks |
| Master Sculptor | Build 10+ emotionally resonant statues |
| Legacy Builder | Statue archived permanently in Codex Museum |
