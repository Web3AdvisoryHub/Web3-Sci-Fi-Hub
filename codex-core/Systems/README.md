## 🧠 What Are Codex Systems?

Codex Systems define how this universe **functions beneath the scrolls.**  
They handle mechanics like:
- 🧬 Token flows
- 🔐 Soulchain identity logic
- 🧩 Scroll fusion
- 🌀 Realm minting triggers
- 🧭 Access tracking

This folder is the operating system of the Codex — where lore meets math, and dreams become logic.

## 🔩 Core System Types

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Tokenomics | $GEN coin utility, mint cost structures, rewards |
| Soulchain | Identity persistence and Builder-linked ownership |
| Fusion | Scroll combination logic and rarity evolution |
| Access Logic | Who sees what, when — tied to quests or realm layers |

---

## 🔐 Tokenomics Engine

- Files like `Genesis_Tokenomics.md` describe how $GEN or $CODA fuels:
  - Avatar building
  - Realm scroll minting
  - Storefront toggles
  - Realm upgrades
- Every transaction sends creator royalties for sustainability

---

## 🧬 Soulchain Identity

- Users' actions, scrolls, and quests leave soulchain marks
- Think: non-transferable proof of progress, identity, or alignment
- Could evolve to include:
  - Emotional memory tokens
  - Builder fingerprints
  - Public legacy trails

---

## 🧩 Fusion Logic

- `Map_Fragment_Fusion_Logic.md` details how scrolls combine into master maps
- Fusion shrines and riddles may be embedded into questlines or realm entry

---

## 🛠 Dev Tips

- All systems must balance:
  - Lore logic 🧙
  - Incentive loops 🪙
  - Player agency 🎮
- Future systems might include:
  - Dynamic tax splits
  - Time-locked scrolls
  - Realm rent systems or rotating visibility
