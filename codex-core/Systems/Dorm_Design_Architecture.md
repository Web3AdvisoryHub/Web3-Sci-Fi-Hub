**Type:** Identity Wallet System  
**Function:** Custom onchain wallet system reimagined as user-owned Dorms — interactive, customizable, identity-rich rooms that grow with the student’s Codex journey.

> “Your wallet is no longer just a key. It is a place.”

## 🌟 What Is a Dorm?

A **Dorm** is a visual, modular identity room that acts as a student’s:
- Wallet
- Profile
- Inventory
- Lore Archive
- Personal Builder space

Every Codex user mints a Dorm to begin their journey. It is the first true proof of identity in the Codex system.

## 🧬 Core Traits

| Trait | Function |
|-------|----------|
| `visual_skin` | Realm Affinity theme (Ocean, Flame, Memory, Dream, Glitch) |
| `scroll_shelf` | Displays unlocked lore scrolls and badges |
| `echo_port` | Echo AI interface for learning + navigation |
| `avatar_anchor` | Avatar customization & skin management |
| `toggle_wall` | Plug-in NFTs (Builder tools, scrolls, apps) |
| `sound_crystal` | Audio environment & music player |
| `guest_layer` | Activated for visitors or business mode |
| `ownership_type` | Soulbound or transferable (Builder decides) |

---

## 🛠️ Functional Capabilities

- Store and visualize NFT scrolls
- Launch quests or minting actions via scrolls
- Customize avatar skin, Dorm layout, and audio
- Display Builder status, achievements, and invite links
- Host business meetings, social events, or classes (toggle Guest Mode)

---

## 🧑‍🚀 Guest Mode Overlay

When users visit without minting their own Dorm:
- Appear in a translucent space suit
- Cannot purchase or interact with Builder tools
- Room shows limited view, no inventory
- Builder may allow entry via invite or $GEN fee

---

## 💸 Economic Layer

- Dorms minted using $GEN Coin
- Additional skins, expansions, and modules = toggle NFTs
- Builders may rent, sell, or host events within their Dorm
- Dorms can hold storefronts or be mirrored in Codex Town Map

---

## 🗺️ Spatial Network

Dorms are clustered in **community tiles** (neighborhoods), forming a Codex galaxy board:
- Grouped by Affinity or Builder Realm
- Mapped on Codex Star Chart
- Can unlock transit portals, community lore, or Builder-run DAOs

---

## 🧠 Lore Overlay

> “The Dorm is not where you live.  
> It is where your echoes begin.”

> “Every scroll you earn… every choice you make…  
> shapes the walls of your Dorm.  
> And the universe remembers.”

---

## 🔓 Future Expansion

- Dorm upgrades (labs, libraries, gardens)
- Connect Dorms to realms or planets
- Let users host their own Codex Schools
- AI-enhanced Dorm assistants
