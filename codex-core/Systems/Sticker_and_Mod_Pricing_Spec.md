 🏷️ Sticker & Avatar Mod Pricing Spec — Customization, Monetization & Visual Economy

> “In the Codex, your style is currency.  
> Every sticker speaks, every mod remembers.”

---

## 🎨 Core Pricing Philosophy

The Codex balances fun, expression, and economics via a **tiered pricing system** for:
- Stickers (used in posts, graffiti, reactions, tattoos)
- Avatar Mods (skins, hair, outfits, emotion effects)

Prices are tagged in **$GEN** or scroll unlocks.

| Type | Base Price ($GEN) | Notes |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| Common (emoji, tags, basic icons) | 0.25 | Daily use, lootable |
| Rare (animated, lore-linked, emotional glow) | 0.75 | Requires scroll or trade |
| Tattoo (binds to avatar or wall) | 1.5 | Unlocks trait |
| Comment/Graffiti Sticker | 0.5 | Can be reused if not burned |
| Sticker Pack (5 randoms) | 1.25 | Loot box style |

## 🧍 Avatar Mod Pricing

| Mod Type | Price ($GEN) | Unlock Method |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Skin Overlay | 2.5 | Via scroll or Builder storefront |
| Pixel Hair / Neon Dye | 1.25 | Includes animated options |

| Trait Tattoo Unlock | 2.0 | May trigger bonus or Echo whisper |

## 📦 Monetization Paths

- **Walls-as-Wallets** store owned stickers, mods, emotion FX
- **Gifting & Tipping** allowed via post reactions

---

## 🛍️ Future Functions
