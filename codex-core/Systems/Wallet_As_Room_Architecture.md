**Type:** Identity System + Modular Interface Logic  
**Purpose:** Redefine Web3 wallets as customizable, visual rooms that hold identity, functionality, and lore — turning abstract addresses into immersive, modular portals.

> “Your wallet is not a container. It is your **first realm**.”

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

Each wallet in the Codex system is represented as a **Room** — a persistent, evolving space that reflects:
- The user's avatar
- Collected scrolls (NFTs, lore, contracts)
- Toggle traits (modular add-ons)
- Achievements and affiliations
- Access permissions (Dorm / Builder / Guest / Portal Admin)

---

## 🧩 Modular Components of the Room

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| 🧍 Avatar | The visual identity worn in Codex space |
| 📜 Scroll Shelf | Displays lore, contracts, or achievements |
| 🎛 Toggle Wall | NFT-activated plug-ins (dapps, quests, utilities) |
| 🔊 Soundscape Crystal | Controls music or ambient energy |
| 🌀 Echo Portal | Entry point for AI assistant Echo |
| 📂 Inventory Archive | Hidden scrolls, tokens, or saved challenges |
| 🪟 Room Skins | Visual overlays, theming based on Realm Affinity |

---

## 🔄 Functional Logic

- Each Room maps 1:1 to a wallet address
- NFT ownership defines what appears in the room
- Rooms are **toggleable** — you can switch overlays, layouts, even identities
- Toggle NFTs act as wallet-native dapps or apps within apps
- Guest/Business mode overlays adjust what others can see/do in your space

---

## 🔐 Room-Based Permissions

| Role | Privileges |
|------|------------|
| Owner | Full control, edit, mint, trade, toggle |
| Guest | Limited view, no interaction, optionally time-limited |
| Builder | May embed quests, rooms, or add inter-realm portals |
| Codex Core | Optional moderator layer for featured rooms |

---

## 📱 Interface Layers

- Mobile and desktop visualized room = UI metaphor
- Clickable shelves, crystals, overlays trigger actions
- Example: Click “Echo Crystal” to summon AI; click “Lore Gate” to mint a scroll

---

## 🌐 Interoperability

- Compatible with Zora, BasePaint, OpenSea visual NFTs
- Rooms exportable to Spatial, Unreal, or AR-layered overlays
- Future: Public view mode vs Builder edit mode

---

## 💠 Lore Tie-In

> “In the Codex, we do not just carry wallets.  
> We carry **worlds**.”

> “A Builder’s room is the first echo of their realm —  
> a place where identity, intent, and invention collide.”

---

## 💫 Summary

Wallets in Codex aren’t cold storage.  
They’re **warm, living spaces** that respond to your choices — and invite others to witness your becoming.
