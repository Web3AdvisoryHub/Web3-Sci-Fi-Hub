2. Places all 4 scrolls into floating fusion slots  
3. Echo voice activates with riddle:  
   > “Only those who wandered… can see the pattern.”  
4. Glyphs align. Constellation pulses.  
5. Mint button activates → Master Star Map NFT created  
6. Unlock path glows in Codex Galaxy and `/realms` becomes active

## 🧙 Lore Notes

> “It was never about the scrolls alone.  
> It was about who gathered them.”

> “Builders who seek what cannot be sold…  
> are the ones the Codex remembers.”
