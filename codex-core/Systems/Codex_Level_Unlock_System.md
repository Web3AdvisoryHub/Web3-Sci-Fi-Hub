# Codex Level Unlock System

This file outlines the step-by-step progression system users experience as they journey through Codex School. The system is intentionally designed to unlock emotional, creative, and technical capacities over time—creating a slow-blooming immersive world that reflects the user's growth.

---

## Overview

Users begin with limited access—one realm, one space, one mode of reflection. As they grow (through journaling, reflection quizzes, Solidity challenges, and interpersonal discovery), they gradually unlock additional realms, avatars, and social features. This creates a deeply personal experience that builds trust and narrative immersion.
