# 🧙 Codex Mentorship Program

**Name:** Echo Path: Mentorship Link  
**Type:** Smart Affiliate + Lore-Based Mentorship Model  
**Purpose:** To allow Codex Builders to guide new students through Codex School — earning rewards, building trust, and creating an evolving network of mentor-echoes within the Codex multiverse.

> “Some echoes return… as teachers.”

## 🔁 Core Loop

| Phase | Mentor (Builder) | Student |
|-------|------------------|---------|
| Join | Shares link or code | Signs up via link or scans Builder scroll |
| Active Journey | Earns % of subscription | Receives guidance and unlocks Builder’s echo logs |
| Graduation | Receives final scroll bonus | Becomes eligible to mentor others |

---

## 🔗 How It Works

### 🔹 Step 1 — Builder Shares Invite
- Each Builder receives a **unique mentorship link** upon scroll mint
- They can also activate “Mentor Mode” and invite someone directly from their realm or dorm

### 🔹 Step 2 — Student Signs Up
- Student is tagged in soulchain as *mentored by* that Builder
- Builder’s scroll becomes temporarily visible in student’s dorm
- Builder can optionally unlock Echo Logs (voice memos or guides)

### 🔹 Step 3 — Mentorship Active
- Builder earns **% of subscription fee** each time the student pays
- Student sees Builder’s “lore trail,” advice, and custom messages
- Mentorship lasts until student:
  - Completes Book One + Book Two
  - Mints Codex Certificate NFT

### 🔹 Step 4 — Graduation Triggers
- Builder receives **Mentor’s Glow Scroll** (optional NFT)
- Student now becomes a Builder
- Revenue split ends + student can now mentor others

## 💠 Visual Layers

- Echo says:  
  > “Your steps echo theirs — and one day, your voice may guide another.”

## 📘 Lore Summary

> “To teach within the Codex is to remember what it meant to be lost —  
> and to never let another wander alone.”

> “Builders who guide others extend the Codex farther than code alone ever could.”
