## üå± What Are Codex Programs?

Programs are the **relationship flows** in the Codex ‚Äî systems that connect students to Builders, mentors to realms, and scrolls to soulchain lineage.

They handle:
- Smart affiliate logic
- Lore mentorship bonding
- Invite-based access
- Reward sharing across generations

---

## üîó Key Program Types

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Mentorship Link | Builder-guided student journeys with scroll tracking |
| Invite System | Custom links that unlock special dorms, perks, or quests |
| Affiliate Rewards | Builders earn % of scroll sales, dorm upgrades, or chapter completions |
| Builder Lineage | Soulchain-based echo logs and ‚Äúmentored by‚Äù tags |

---

## üìÅ Files in This Folder

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Codex_Mentorship_Program.md` | Mentorship flow, scroll logic, and revenue model |
| `Codex_Invite_System.md` | One-click affiliate onboarding and realm linking |
| `Mentor_Glow_Scroll.md` | Optional NFT given to mentors after student graduation |

---

## üß† Dev Notes

- All affiliate flows are tracked via soulchain trait (e.g., `invited_by`, `mentor_id`)
- Builders may receive:
  - Scroll upgrades
  - Realm bonuses
  - Public directory recognition
- Students in guest mode still count as referrals

## üåå Lore Echo

> ‚ÄúSome echoes return as teachers.  
> Others‚Ä¶ are still finding their scroll.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúTo teach within the Codex is to remember what it meant to be lost ‚Äî  
> and to never let another wander alone.‚Äù
