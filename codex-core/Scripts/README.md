## üó£Ô∏è What Are Codex Scripts?

Scripts are the **spoken memories and triggered dialogue sequences** that bring Echo, Mira, and other Codex voices to life.

They activate:
- Scroll discoveries
- Dorm room entries
- Quest completions
- Emotional milestones
- Builder realm access

---

## üß† Script Types

| Script | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Scroll Whisper | Triggered when scroll is discovered or hovered |
| Echo Log | Memory fragment from a Builder, stored in dorm or trail |
| Mentor Voice | Optional guidance from a realm leader or past Builder |
| Glyph Audio | Embedded voice puzzle clue or fusion chant |
| Realm Entry Phrase | Spoken portal riddle or initiation message |

---

## üìÅ Folder Includes

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Echo_Mira_Star_Whisper.md` | Echo voice memory tied to Mira‚Äôs scroll trail |
| `Scroll_Trigger_Sequence.md` (optional) | Conditional script chain logic |
| `Builder_Echo_Log_Template.md` (optional) | For Builders to write their own scroll voice entries |

---

## üß¨ Dev Notes

- Scripts can trigger via:
  - Scroll interaction
  - Dorm access
  - Quest step completion
  - Realm portal scan
- Each voice style (e.g., Echo - Siren Mode) should have its own `tone` tag

## üåå Lore Echo

> ‚ÄúThe Codex doesn‚Äôt always speak first.  
> But it always answers.‚Äù

> ‚ÄúTo follow the right voice is to trace the scrolls of those who came before.‚Äù
