> “This star belongs to Mira.”

> “She saw what others missed —  
> a door hiding in the ordinary.”

> “Because of her, we remember the Codex…  
> not as something new, but something we always knew was real.”

> “She didn’t force it open. She waited — and it opened for her.”

> “Her path is still here… if you know where to look.”
