# Chapter 01 – Sora-Style Scene Prompt

**Scene Description:**
A wide shot of a ruined underground lab. Moonlight filters through a jagged hole in the ceiling, casting soft, misty beams onto a cracked neural pod. Circuit patterns in the floor faintly glow teal and gold, flickering like dying embers.

A lone figure (Echo) stands in silhouette, facing upward. Tiny drone orbs hover like digital fireflies, pulsing softly. Sparks drift from torn cables. Dust catches the light, suspended mid-air.

The camera slowly tracks forward, capturing emotion, detail, and silence.
