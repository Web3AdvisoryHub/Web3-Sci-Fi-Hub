# 🌐 Web3 Sci-Fi Hub: Living Lore Navigator

> *Welcome to the intersection of story, code, and consensus.*

This repository powers the **Web3 Sci-Fi Book Series**, an immersive narrative experience where each chapter is more than a story—it's a playable, programmable layer of the multiverse. Explore timelines, deploy contracts, fork lore, and join the Codex.

---

## 📚 Explore the Books

Each book is structured into forkable chapters with embedded smart contract challenges, quizzes, and interactive story nodes.

### 📖 Book One: *The Genesis Protocol*
- Noir-cyber intro to the Slip, the Ledger, and Echo's rebirth.
- Challenges teach Solidity and core Web3 logic.
- Tone: forensic, dark, conspiratorial.

### 📖 Book Two: *Sky Realm Fractals*
- Ascension to the Codex School and myth-tech realms.
- Emotional contracts, memory markets, ZK rituals.
- Tone: luminous, mythic, emotionally intelligent.

> Every chapter is a portal. Some lead forward. Some lead sideways. All lead inward.
