### ðŸ”’ Challenge Prompt (For Remix)

```text
Challenge: Can you deploy this contract and verify that its state is immutable?

Objective:
- Deploy this contract using Remix.
- Try to call a non-existent function to change `purpose`.
- Observe the read-only nature of the deployed contract.

âœ¨ Bonus Exploration:
- What happens if the commented `updatePurpose` function is included?
- How does immutability support trust in a decentralized system?
```
